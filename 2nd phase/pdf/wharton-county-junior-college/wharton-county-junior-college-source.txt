Learning Framework Or EDUC 1300 Core 090
A study of the 1) research and theory in the psychology of learning, cognition, and motivation, 2) factors that impact learning, and
3) application of learning strategies. Theoretical models of strategic learning, cognition, and motivation serve as the conceptual basis for the introduction of college-level student academic strategies. Students use assessment instruments (e.g., learning inventories) to help them identify their own strengths and weaknesses as strategic learners. Students are ultimately expected to integrate and apply the learning skills discussed across their own academic programs and become effective and efficient learners. Students developing these skills should be able to continually draw from the theoretical models they have learned. (Cross listed as EDUC 1300)
