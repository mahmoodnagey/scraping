Course Standard
Course Information
Description	JavaScript is a scripting language of the web. As the web evolves from a static to a dynamic environment, technology focus is shifting from static markup and styling— frequently handled by content management systems or automated scripts—to dynamic interfaces and advanced interaction. Once seen as optional, JavaScript is now becoming an integral part of the web, infusing every layer with its script. Object- Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to using self-contained pieces of code to develop applications. IT professionals call these self-contained pieces of code objects, better known as Classes in most OOP programming languages and Functions in JavaScript. IT professionals use objects as building blocks for our applications. Building applications with objects allows us to adopt some valuable techniques. In this course students will build their understanding of JavaScript piece by piece, from core principles like variables, data types, conditionals, and functions through advanced topics including loops, closures, DOM printing, and learn Inheritance and Encapsulation since only these two concepts apply to OOP in JavaScript; in JavaScript objects can encapsulate functionalities and inherit methods and properties from other objects.

Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity, object oriented application, and code reuse. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to using self-contained pieces of code to develop applications. IT Professionals call these self-contained pieces of code objects, better known as Classes in Python. IT Professionals use objects as building blocks for scripting and applications which allows us to adopt some valuable techniques. In this course students will build their understanding of Python piece by piece starting with the basics and work into algorithms, standard libraries, GUI development, and generators. At the end of this course students will be fully proficient in python having covered advanced python development as well as parallel and concurrent programming.

CLD 170 Cloud Application Development II (Serverless REACT on AWS)



Course Standard
Course Information
Description	Traditionally companies have built and deployed web applications where they have some degree of control typically running on a server and are responsible for provisioning and managing the resources for it. There are a few issues with this be it server uptime, maintenance costs, managing security, and scalability. It is far more competitive now to run applications on the cloud. Serverless computing (or serverless for short), is an execution model where the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) is responsible for executing a piece of code by dynamically allocating the resources. And only charging for the amount of resources used to run the code. The code that is sent to the cloud provider for execution is usually in the form of a function. Hence serverless is sometimes referred to as “Functions as a Service” or “FaaS”. This hands-on course is meant for developers that would like to build full-stack serverless applications. By guiding students step-by-step through both the frontend and the backend they will cover all the different aspects of building their first full automated full-stack serverless React app on the cloud.

INF 121 Object-Oriented Programming (JavaScript)
Course Standard
Course Information
Description	JavaScript is a scripting language of the web. As the web evolves from a static to a dynamic environment, technology focus is shifting from static markup and styling— frequently handled by content management systems or automated scripts—to dynamic interfaces and advanced interaction. Once seen as optional, JavaScript is now becoming an integral part of the web, infusing every layer with its script. Object- Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to using self-contained pieces of code to




develop applications. IT professionals call these self-contained pieces of code objects, better known as Classes in most OOP programming languages and Functions in JavaScript. IT professionals use objects as building blocks for our applications. Building applications with objects allows us to adopt some valuable techniques. In this course students will build their understanding of JavaScript piece by piece, from core principles like variables, data types, conditionals, and functions through advanced topics including loops, closures, DOM printing, and learn Inheritance and Encapsulation since only these two concepts apply to OOP in JavaScript; in JavaScript objects can encapsulate functionalities and inherit methods and properties from other objects.

Course Information
Description	Traditionally companies have built and deployed web applications where they have some degree of control typically running on a server and are responsible for provisioning and managing the resources for it. There are a few issues with this be it server uptime, maintenance costs, managing security, and scalability. It is far more competitive now to run applications on the cloud. Serverless computing (or serverless for short), is an execution model where the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) is responsible for executing a piece of code by dynamically allocating the resources. And only charging for the amount of resources used to run the code. The code that is sent to the cloud provider for execution is usually in the form of a function. Hence serverless is sometimes referred to as “Functions as a Service” or “FaaS”. This hands-on course is meant for developers that would like to build full-stack serverless applications. By guiding students step-by-step through both the frontend and the backend they will cover all the different aspects of building their first full automated full-stack serverless React app on the cloud.
