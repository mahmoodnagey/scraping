MONSTERS IN POPULAR CULTURE. This class analyzes ontological, psychoanalytical, and 
symbolic expressions of monstrosity in various media texts, especially as they relate to race, 
colonialism, immigration, class, gender and sexuality, and labor and capitalism. Specifically, we will 
explore what the figure of the monster, be it zombies, werewolves, mass shooters, or vampires, can 
tell us about the cultural context and the cultural norms in which it emerges. The investigation of 
these varied iterations of monstrosity offers students unique opportunities to engage with and 
challenge popular culture in critical and meaningful ways. (H) 
75-654 
MUSLIMS IN THE MEDIA. This class examines the representations of Muslims in Western media. 
This includes exploring how popular discourse constructs Muslims, and how Muslims themselves 
participate in media discourse. This class also emphasizes identifying how the rhetorical strategies 
used to marginalize Muslims overlap with the strategies used to diminish other groups in the United 
States, thus establishing how power reproduces itself. Contributes to Feminist Studies, and  Race and 
Ethnicity Studies/Group-Theme Course. (H) (SJ)  
75-674 
FILM STUDIES. This course introduces students to critical, analytical and theoretical approaches to

consideration of feminist film criticism and theory from 1975 to the present, and is intended for 
students who are interested in film studies and who have some experience with critical reading, 
106 
 
writing, and theoretical analysis. Contributes to Feminist Studies.  Prerequisite: English 10-244, 
English 10-254, Feminist Studies 04-104 or permission of instructor. (H) (SJ)

gangster films), New Hollywood and digital technology are among the organizing principles of this 
survey. (H) 
10-534 
REEL WORLDS: DOCUMENTARY FILM STUDIES. Many people believe that documentary films 
simply reflect and represent "real worlds." To a certain extent this assumption is true: documentary 
films do purport to represent real people, events, and historical circumstances, and promise to tell 
fact-based stories that are fundamentally true. This course will explore this assumption while also 
focusing on the ways that documentary filmmakers bring their own interpretations to the stories they 
are telling, and are always (subtly or overtly) trying to persuade us to adopt their particular 
perspective about the real worlds they depict. (H) 
10-544 
SCIENCE FICTION FILM. This course will follow the development of science fiction cinema from 
the silent shorts of the early 20th century to today’s blockbusters. As we explore this history, paying 
attention to formal and aesthetic elements of the film genre, we’ll also trace how science fiction has 
reflected the circumstances and concerns of its moment. We’ll emphasize three recurrent themes that 
shape ideas about modernity and progress: our ambivalent relationship to technology; the uncannily 
permeable boundaries of the human (both body and species); and the shifting forms of empire and 
capital against which individual lives play out. Our film screenings will be paired with readings 
drawn from science fiction literature and criticism as well as social and critical theory. This is a class 
that invites rich interdisciplinary connection and “Paideia moments”: as we learn about the history of 
science fiction as a film genre, we will also use our growing knowledge of that genre to ask critical 
questions about how science and technology are inextricable from issues of power and embodiment, 
and how popular culture circulates, reflects, and refracts these complex realities. (H) 
10-604

AMERICAN ENVIRONMENTAL LITERATURES. This course will explore how modern and 
contemporary U.S. writers have articulated the intimate connections between “nature” and “culture” 
in the context of environmental and social justice. Paying particular attention to the women writers, 
queer writers, and writers of color whom mainstream environmental conversations have often 
constitutively excluded, we will consider how divergent visions of nature (as pristine wilderness 
outside of human reach; as site of/ constituted by violence; as not dualistically separated from 
humanity; etc.) have inflected both American poetics and American politics—and, conversely, how 
the literature of environmental justice re-maps and re-envisions U.S. politics, histories, and myths.

Asia as a unit of historical inquiry. Major themes include political history, ethnic discourses and 
practices, the localization of Buddhism, indigenous religions, inter-state relations, urban life, gender, 
family, and intellectual change. These themes allow us to deliberate the formation of the East Asian 
world and the exchanges of the premodern era. Contributes to Early Modern Studies, East Asian

of China, Japan, and Korea since 1800 until the present day. Major topics include cultural exchanges, 
revolutions, war, imperialism, colonialism, and Cold War geopolitics. While globalizing forces 
oversaw the convergence of East Asia and European imperialism, politicians, intellectuals, and even 
commoners began to imagine themselves as members of distinct “nations”. By placing the emergence 
of East Asian nation-states and the interactions among them within the context of an increasingly 
connected world, we explore the making of the modern East Asian world. Contributes to East Asian 
Studies and International Studies. (Biennially) (H)

wars of independence of the 19th century. By examining pre-Colombian states, early European 
explorations, la conquista, the settlement of mostly Spanish but also Portuguese and other European 
colonies, and the responses of a diverse group of local inhabitants, this course explores the complex 
societies that resulted from the growth and end of global empires and that shaped the future of this 
diverse region. Contributes to Early Modern Studies, Health Studies, International Studies, Latin

that these countries followed, including the rise of nationalism and its overcoming by the neocolonial 
order, the revolutionary option in Mexico, Cuba, and Nicaragua during the 20th century, the 
authoritarian responses to national discontent, and the rise of neoliberalism. It also explores how these 
trends transformed the society, culture, economy, and policies at the local level in response to both 
national and international influences. Contributes to International Studies, Latin American and Border 
Studies, and Race and Ethnicity Studies/Group-Theme Course. (Biennially) (H)

Anthropology - ANTH  (CYA) 
05-364, 05-464  
ANTHROPOLOGY OF THE CITY: EXPLORING MODERN ATHENS.  This course has a three-
pronged approach to exploring Athens. The first is general: we will study the "city" as both a concept 
and a material reality, and the theories and issues anthropologists bring to the study of the city. The 
second takes us to the specific: how can we apply those ideas to the city we will be located in, to 
Athens? The third brings us the tools necessary to collect the data for that exploration: the qualitative 
methodologies used in the social sciences to study the spaces, people, practices, sounds, tastes, ideas, 
fields of power, and more that make up everyday life in this incredible city you'll be making your 
temporary home. We will be systematically studying Athens in its material reality, in the experiences 
it shapes, and in the experiences, people shape it with. We will be engaging with how the city 
intersects with gender and sexuality, inequality, migration, sustainability, consumption, capitalism, 
politics, activism, state power, housing and homelessness, art, pleasure, and more. This course will 
require you to be brave and open-minded, in interacting with strangers and new places. You will try 
new things you end up loving and other new things you end up greatly disliking. By learning to live in 
and understand another culture, you will also learn more about yourself and your own prejudices and 
predispositions. Winter Intersession. (ANTH 315, ANTH 415) 
05-344, 05-444  
THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF FOOD IN GREECE. The “Mediterranean Diet” has received a great 
deal of attention as a dietary pattern with significant health benefits. To think of diet in this way, 
however, is to think of food as simply nutrition. The rich symbolic life of food, its place in social 
relationships, its importance to ritual, its connection to identity, its deliciousness: all of these are lost 
if we focus on diet as diet alone. In this course, we will look at the development of the Mediterranean 
diet in Greece, as well as other contemporary food practices. We will address issues of globalization, 
food tourism, food security, “local”, “traditional,” and “slow” foods, and much more. When not in the 
classroom, we will visit farms, vineyards, groves, restaurants, markets, museums, kitchens, sweet 
shops, cooperatives, NGOs, and festivals in our quest to experientially study food in Greece. This is a 
hands-on course in terms of tasting and experiencing food! Summer Session. (ANTH 325, ANTH 425) 
05-354, 05-454  
TASTING CULTURE: NORDIC AND MEDITERRANEAN FOOD, TRADITION, AND 
NUTRITION.  We eat to live. But food is not just about survival, it is about so much more: health, 
pleasure, identity, symbolism, class, memory, sensation, and on and on. We express who we are 
through our food. But how we eat is also shaped by other forces: doctors’ advice, economic ability, 
government regulations, climate, history, and many other factors often invisible to us in our everyday 
lives. Over four weeks we will explore two distinct cultural contexts in Europe—Denmark and 
Greece—allowing us to understand both the commonalities and the differences that such forces bring 
to food and cuisine, as well as people’s imagination and inventiveness in creating something to eat. 
The course begins in Copenhagen, Denmark, the emergent capital of New Nordic Cuisine, where 
tradition is being reinvented at levels both every day and haute cuisine. To balance our understanding 
of urban food ways, we will also spend a couple of days on the rural island community of Samsø, 
known for quality produce and sustainable living. The course continues in Athens, Greece, a country 
associated with the Mediterranean diet and a strong cultural history of knowledge and attention to 
food, with a few days on the island of Naxos as well, to explore the locality of food traditions and 
production. These four locations will enable to do comparative research and both explore and 
deconstruct the categories of new/old, urban/rural, north/south, global/local, tradition/modernity, and 
change/continuity. Along the way, the medicalization of diets, changes in agriculture, food tourism, 
food security, nationalism, locality, sustainability, and more will be addressed. When not in the 
classroom, we will visit farms, vineyards, groves, restaurants, markets, museums, kitchens, sweet 
shops, cooperatives, NGOs, and festivals in our quest to experientially study food, and taste 
everything that comes our way. By taking this class, students will develop a sound understanding of 
how food is studied as an expression of society and culture, and hands-on training in the 
methodologies used to examine food and food practices. Summer Session. (ANTH 326, ANTH 426) 
05-313, 05-413  
THE CULTURE OF MODERN GREECE. Students studying abroad are already like anthropologists, 
trying to make sense of the rules of the society around them so that they can adapt to the rhythms and 
practices of their new, temporary home. This class gives students the tools needed to fully engage 
with and understand life in Greece, offering the history and social context needed to give their 
experiences greater depth and meaning. We will learn the methods anthropologists use to study 
238 
 
societies, and employ them to investigate Greece in ways students might not otherwise find on their 
own. Our explorations are broad, covering religion, food, immigration, Europeanization, family, 
youth culture, economy and politics, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, and more; we will treat 
these topics as overlapping realms that shape everyday experience. The aim is for students to gain an 
understanding of contemporary society in Greece, and a developing awareness of their own cultural 
conditionings and ethnocentrisms. Fall Semester. (ANTH 333, ANTH 433) 
05-323, 05-423  
GENDER & SEXUALITY IN MODERN GREEK CULTURE .  How do social scientists approach 
the subjects of gender and sexuality? What can students learn about life in modern Greece when we 
apply this lens? This course combines readings from across the social sciences and first-hand 
participant-observation research to answer these questions. We’ll be discussing gender and sexuality 
in their intersections in Greece with kinship, religion, economy, national and international politics, 
technology, medicine, modernity, ethnicity, race, and more, giving us a particular insight into 
important aspects of change (and continuity) in this region. Students will be also be introduced to the 
methodologies of anthropological research, providing you with the tools to enrich your experience in 
Greece through a focused, curious, and analytical engagement with the cultures you’re immersed in 
here (and with your own position here as a student/tourist/traveler/foreigner/gendered person), and to 
explore aspects of the society first-hand that you might not find on your own. Spring Semester.

05-333, 05-433  
SOLIDARITY|SOCIAL MOVMTS|JUSTICE:SERVICE LEARNING. Greece has seen the 
development of a number of social movements and “solidarity” movements in recent years, in the 
face of the difficult social conditions after the 2009 sovereign debt crisis and the austerity measures 
which followed.  Some of these efforts are new and creative responses, while others have long 
histories in Greek society and politics.  This course examines the roles that solidarity and social 
movements, social justice goals, and civil society development play in contemporary Greek society. 
What are the social problems currently being struggled with in Greece? In what ways have people 
responded?  Students each volunteer for such organizations, on topics ranging from the environment, 
refugee housing, food security, human rights and equality, and more, and their volunteer experiences 
are integrated into the course, providing an experiential dimension to the questions we will be 
exploring together. Spring Semester. (ANTH 357, ANTH 457)

Archaeological Excavations - ARCX  (CYA) 
18-314, 18-414 
EXCAVATIONS AT AIXONIDAI HALAI - VOULA FIELD SCHOOL.  The Winter Intersession 
evolves around the physical excavation of a site near the modern Athenian suburb of Voula, which, in 
antiquity, was associated with Aixonides Halai, one of the ten demes (municipalities) of ancient 
Attica. The course consists of two main teaching components. The first is an on-site excavation, and 
lab-work focusing on experiential learning, aimed primarily at introducing students to aspects of 
archaeological fieldwork and all related elements of current research methodology and theory, under 
the supervision of trained professionals. The second consists of class lectures, which enhance the 
“hands on” experience by placing it within the proper wider historical and otherwise setting/context.  
For the on-site excavation portion of the course, students work under the supervision of archaeologists 
from the Greek Ministry of Culture and the Greek Archaeological Service. Classes meet at CYA each 
afternoon following the morning excavation sessions. In addition to the above, the course also 
includes visits to nearby archaeological excavation sites as well as to other relevant sites and 
museums of historical importance in Athens and Piraeus. Winter Intersession. (ARCX 320, ARCX

EXCAVATING IN THE AEGEAN - DESPOTIKO FIELD SCHOOL. The course introduces students 
to archaeological fieldwork methods and theory through active participation in the systematic 
excavation of the sanctuary of Apollo situated on the uninhabited islet of Despotiko, the most 
important Cycladic sanctuary after Delos. The last week’s class takes place at the Archeological  
 
239 
 
Museum of Paros where students will be trained in processing finds. The first three weeks are on-site 
learning basic methods of excavating, measuring and recording. Students gain comprehension of the 
purposes of an excavation and learn how to place the sanctuary and its material culture in a theoretical 
context. Summer Session. (ARCX 321, ARCX 421)

INTRO TO DIGITAL ARCHAEOLOGY.  Methods of documentation and analysis in archaeology 
have changed drastically in the last decade. The course provides students with theoretical knowledge 
on the state of the art in digital archaeology, including GIS, remote-sensing technologies, tablet-based 
field recording, data management, and, last but not least, theoretical debates on the usefulness of 
digital methods. Students also acquire real-world skills: they create 3D models of artifacts and 
trenches; they create aerial maps using drone photos; they learn how to set-up and use a Total Station 
on the field; and they digitally illustrate 2D architectural features using geo-rectified photos. Fall

AEG/ANC GK ART & ARCHAEOLOGY.  A survey course, with extensive on-site teaching, 
covering the art and archaeology of Greece from prehistoric times to the end of the Classical period. 
Its purpose is to introduce the student, using whenever possible the primary sources (monuments, art 
and artifacts) of the ancient civilizations of the Aegean and Greece: Minoan, Mycenaean, and 
Classical Greek. Classroom lectures and the readings provide the historical context for the 
monuments and artifacts students are instructed on. Cannot be taken with 01-323 (ARCH 361).  Fall

DIVERSITY|DIFFERENCE|REGIONALITY AMONG GREEKSTATES.  The weight of Classical 
texts about Athens or by Athenians has led to a concentration on this one ancient polis, an 
Athenocentricity that needs to be balanced by the archaeological record across the rest of the ancient 
Greece world. Was Athens the typical polis, the norm, the exemplar, or quite unique? Did other Greek 
states behave like the Athenians in their cultural, religious, or political lives? Did all Greeks have the 
same norms and taboos concerning gender, sex and sexuality? These questions and many others will 
be explored during this intensive 4-week tour of Greece, which will cover many regions of the 
country in order to bring out the local differences in material culture, literary and epigraphic 
traditions, and archaeological remains. We will visit archaeological sites and museums and use the 
evidence presented to discuss issues of race, ethnicity, social structures, language and communication, 
war, politics, slavery, and religion. Summer Session. (ARCH 346).

WHEN EGYPT MEETS THE AEGEAN. The course explores the relationship of Egyptian and Greek 
cultures in the Bronze Age within the wider Eastern Mediterranean context. Focal points of the course 
are the Egyptian Collection in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, Akrotiri in Santorini 
(the Pompeii of the Prehistoric Aegean), Crete, and Mycenae. Students have the very rare opportunity 
to experience hands-on activities and behind the scenes visits which allows them to comprehend more 
deeply the culture through actual contact with artifacts. In addition, distinguished scholars and 
specialists of Greek archaeology share their academic interests and excitement. Summer Session.

THE TOPOGRAPHY AND MONUMENTS OF ATHENS.  Please note: This course is a detailed 
archaeology course intended for students with some background in archaeology and/or ancient 
history.  This exclusively site-based course gives a comprehensive overview of the topography, 
archaeology and history of Athens, focusing particularly on the great monuments of the Classical and 
Roman city. It explores every major site - and many minor ones- paying attention to their physical 
setting, architectural and archaeological characteristics, and position in the political, religious and 
social lives of the Athenians. Thucydides put into the mouth of Pericles the words, ‘Future ages will 
wonder at us, as the present age wonders at us now.’ Future ages did indeed wonder at the buildings 
of the ancient city, and this course traces the rediscovery of Athens’ antiquities from the earliest 
modern travelers to Greece in the 15th century, through to the development of scientific archaeology 
in the 19th, and indeed looks into the role of archaeology in Athens from the foundation of the Modern 
Greek state up to the present day. Students gain a wide range of key skills during the course: 
topographic interpretation from maps and site plans with an understanding of how landscape affects 
site development; research skills from assessing publications from excavation reports to antiquarian 
rare books and archival or photographic collections; oral presentation skills through preparing 
240 
 
individual reports presented on site to the group; as well as gaining an ability to use the evidence of 
archaeology, architecture, inscriptions, and coins in the construction of historical arguments. 
Prerequisite: Background in archaeology and/or ancient history. Cannot be taken with 01-313 (ARCH 
331).  Fall and Spring Semesters. (ARCH 361, ARCH 461) 
01-363, 01-463  
AEGEAN PREHISTORY: THE BRONZE AGE. This course provides an exploration of the Aegean 
prehistory from the Neolithic times up to the beginning of the Iron Age, focusing primarily on the 
Bronze Age cultures that flourished in the region. The archaeology of the islands and the mainland 
will be placed within the greater Eastern Mediterranean cultural sphere in order to achieve an in-depth 
survey of the various aspects of political, artistic, technological, religious, administrative and social 
dynamics of the Bronze Age people. Students are introduced to theoretical and interpretative 
methodologies, current debates as well as old and modern approaches of studying the available corpus 
of archaeological data. At the same time, the results of new and on-going research projects and 
excavations are discussed offering a fresh look on the large number of sites in the areas of interest. 
Finally, students are able to experience site and museum visits as well as hands-on activities and 
study closely the construction, function, circulation and consumption of the abundant material culture 
of the Aegean Bronze Age. Prerequisite: Background in archaeology and/or ancient history. Cannot 
be taken with 01-313 (ARCH 331). Fall Semester. (ARCH 367, ARCH 467) 
01-373, 01-473 
ANCIENT MATERIALS & TECHNOLOGIES. The course investigates a range of processes through 
which raw materials –e.g. clay, wood and marble - were shaped into objects such as the Dipylon 
Vases, Kouroi sculptures, temple friezes, jewelry. Students examine a range of objects of Greek 
origin, from Neolithic to Hellenistic and Roman times and beyond, focusing on techniques and 
materials that were employed to produce both objects that featured in people’s daily life as well as 
luxury commodities. Much of the course is taught outside the classroom, taking advantage of the 
museums and archaeological sites. Students are able to discover how skilled Greek societies were in 
transforming raw materials into functioning objects, and gain an understanding of the value of the 
material remains within their original Greek context. Although this is not a laboratory-based course, it 
touches upon analytical techniques employed to investigate some of the most commonly used 
materials. Spring Semester. (ARCH 372, ARCH 472) 
01-483  
ARCHAEOLOGICAL DRAWING.  For students planning to pursue a career in archaeology, this 
course develops basic techniques in drawing pottery and other archaeological finds, such as bone, 
metal, stone and figurines. The course is important, as students first learn the fundamentals of 
observing objects before they learn how to draw them. They can then apply and expand on these 
fundamentals when working with newer recording technologies such as digital recording, and 3-D 
scanning and imaging. Indeed, to make the imagery work students need to know how to see an object, 
which they learn from drawing. The skills acquired have enabled students to work at many 
excavations, e.g. in Egypt, at Troy, and in the Athenian Agora. Enrollment is limited to eight students.

BYZANTINE ART AND ARCHITECTURE. The course aims to explore the Byzantine artistic 
production from its origins in the catacomb frescoes of second-century Rome and the Syro-Palaistine 
region, to the art produced during the last centuries of the empire. It aims to provide an introduction to 
the varied physical remains left behind by the Byzantines: architecture (urban as well as rural), 
painting (mural decoration, icon painting and manuscript illumination), luxury objects of the so-called  
 
241 
 
minor arts as well as objects destined for every day, mainly secular, use. The study of the material is 
not confined to the examination of the evolving ‘styles’ and ‘iconographies’ –the pictorial languages 
of these artefacts- but hopes to survey the role of the image in Byzantium as a complex product of 
specific historical, theological and broader political influences considering its use both in religious 
and secular contexts, matters of gender and patronage as well as the cross-cultural exchanges in the 
Mediterranean basin during the Byzantine era. Part of the course examines the various ways through 
which the Byzantine culture influenced the new humanism of the early-Renaissance Europe as well as 
modern perceptions of Byzantium. Class sessions combine lectures, in-depth discussions on primary 
texts and focus on visual and literary material in order to provide a holistic introduction to Eastern 
Mediterranean culture during the Byzantine period. Besides the lectures, guided visits to Byzantine 
monuments are part of the course. The monastery of Hossios Loukas, a functioning establishment to 
date with lavish mosaic decoration dating back to the 11th c., and the castle-state of Mistras in the 
Peloponnese with its numerous frescoed churches and chapels, have been included in the Peloponnese 
field trip itinerary. To gain a broader first-hand understanding of the agenda of the image in 
Byzantium, visits to Hagios Dimitrios, the Acheiropoietos and Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki are part 
of the northern Greece field trip. Finally, the course aims to explore, in three visits, the Byzantine 
collections, the museums and the surviving Byzantine churches of Athens. Spring Semester.  (ARCT

surviving architectural monuments of Athens. In order students may profit as greatly as possible from 
first-hand, visual contact with the monuments that are the object of their study, almost all sessions of 
the course are held on the Acropolis, the Agora, and other major Athenian sites. Cannot be taken with

PERFORMING (IN) ATHENS: EXPLORING THE CITY THROUGH THEATRE AND 
PERFORMANCE.  Athens is considered one of the most vibrant theatre scenes in Europe. We will 
focus on current practices in theatre and performance mainly in Greece, but also in Europe and the 
United States. We will undertake a critical, historical and creative overview of theatre and 
performance making in periods of crisis, in Europe and the United States, and examine how 
contemporary Greek artists address issues such as: theatre and society, the human body/the body 
politic, and the stage and the city. We will also perform a slight backtrack into the ancient past and the 
beginnings of theatre in its birthplace. The course will include visits to different theatres and other 
performance spaces: a theatre in a train, a 19th century proscenium theatre, underground performance 
spaces, together with backstage tours and talks with artists. This course is for students in the Arts and 
Humanities and anyone interested in theatre and performance. Fall Semester. (ARTH 320, ARTH 420)

PHOTOGRAPHY AND ARCHAEOLOGY: THE ART OF DOCUMENTATION.  The study of the 
relationship between photography and archaeology requires a multi-disciplinary approach. We must 
be practitioners and theorists, researchers and analysts, approaching archaeological photography from 
a variety of angles. Through lectures and viewing the work of major figures in the field, you will 
become familiar with the development of the medium alongside the discipline of archaeology. 
Through site visits and hands-on experience with specialized equipment, you will gain insight into the 
mechanics of photography and how it shapes vision. Through examining case-studies and conducting 
your own research you will discover how photography has often held up a mirror to the greater 
cultural contexts of archaeology. Spring Semester. (ARTH 323, ARTH 423)

PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE CITY: PICTURING THE POLIS.  In this course we will be taking a 
multi-disciplinary approach to examine the ways photography has been used to represent the city.  In 
doing so, we will use the city of Athens as a case study because thanks to its ancient past, Athens 
began to be photographed soon after the invention of photography.  We will therefore be following in 
the footsteps of some of the first photographers of the city all the way up to the street photographers 
of the present to understand what they are showing us and how it may - or may not - relate to our own 
lived experience of Athens. We will also be analyzing photographs from photographic archives 
considering what information they are communicating to us and what further information we can 
establish from them. Fall and Spring Semester. (ARTH 327, ARTH 427)

ISLOMANIA: AN EXPLORATION OF CONTEMPORARY ART IN THE GREEK ISLANDS.  
Greek islands, especially in the summer, have been inscribed in the collective consciousness as 
utopias of leisure, fun, the beach, and a laid-back lifestyle. On the other hand, contemporary art is 
identified with cutting-edge interpretations of the human condition, offering ample opportunities for 
aesthetic appreciation, but also contemplation and personal transformations. Interestingly, in the past 
few years, a beautiful paradox has been observed, leading to an increasing trend: Greek islands as a 
destination for contemporary art world-class shows, ranging from group shows of emerging artists to 
a glorious recent solo Jeff Koons show on the island of Hydra. Prestigious foundations, 
internationally acclaimed artists, sensational venues, and imaginative exhibitions, all can be found in 
a plethora of island settings. The ‘experiment’ is paying off, with the popularity, visibility, and 
visitability of the aforementioned shows on the rise. The course will follow this trajectory via a 
contemporary art island hopping process, while also exploring the main(stream) scene for 
contemporary art in Greece in Athens and Thessaloniki . A brief history of contemporary art and its 
curatorial practices will establish the context of the course, before we travel around, immersing 
ourselves in art. The range of venues we will visit spans from the National Museum of Contemporary 
Art, archaeological museums and monuments engaging in contemporary art to commercial galleries, 
private foundations, state institutions, popup summer-only events, gardens, derelict buildings and the 
street-as-art gallery. Summer Session. (ARTH 340)

HISTORY OF CONTEMPORARY ART IN GREECE Contemporary art is defined as the art 
movements that emerged in the post-WWII world. From expressionism to performance art, 
installations, and video art, to NFTs; from the Venice Biennale to its plethora of offshoots around the 
globe; from the legitimation of street art as a gallery-worthy form of art; Contemporary art in Greece 
was foremost produced by Greek ex-pats who came into contact with the international avant-garde of 
their time, especially in France, Italy, and the USA. The picture changed radically in the 1980s, when 
the domestic contemporary art production caught up, an audience was established and galleries started 
emerging, which culminated institutionally in the 1990s with the establishment of the Syndemos 
Aithouson. Students acquire first-hand knowledge of the contemporary art scene in Greece, in a 
course combining class lectures that explore the history and theory of contemporary art, with regular 
scheduled site visits. The latter range from the iconic EMST, National Museum of Contemporary Art, 
and the National Gallery, to Foundations, such as the Takis Foundation, private commercial galleries, 
including but not limited to legends, such as Citronne and The Breeder, temporary exhibitions, in 
expected, but also in surprising unconventional venues; field walks to discuss the public presence of 
contemporary art in Athens; and contemporary art archives. In addition, visits to artists’ studios 
facilitate an interaction with the producers of contemporary art today, and help the students 
familiarize themselves with the artistic process, contextualizing the artistic production spatially. Last 
but not least, the work of the Professor as an independent contemporary art curator is discussed 
critically and students have the opportunity to watch a show coming to life, depending on the 
Professor’s curating commitments each semester. Contemporary art is in a state of flow: this is its 
basic tenet and the key to understanding and interpreting its many faces. The emerging Greek artists 
of today will be the established stars in the histories of contemporary art of tomorrow. Spring

MEDIEVAL GREECE: BYZANTINE|ISLAMICATE|SLAVIC|JEWISH&FRANKISH 
HERITAGES IN THE AEGEAN Was there life in Greece after the Classics? What happened to the 
Greek lands after the Classical period and until Early Modern times? Who were the Byzantines and 
why did they call themselves Romans? And if Byzantines identified themselves as Romans, then who 
were the Latins from Italy, France, and the rest of Western Europe who conquered much of Greece in 
the 13th century? Did you know that an Islamic Emirate ruled much of the Aegean for two centuries? 
And that many place names even in the south most of Greece originate from the Slavic language 
spoken by migrating population in these areas in the early Middle Ages? Or that the Ottoman sultan 
in 15th c. Istanbul was regarded by many Greek-speaking as the continuation of the Byzantine 
emperor? Fall Semester. (ARTH 347, ARTH 447)

THE PRESENT PAST: RE-IMAGINING GREECE THROUGH HERITAGE.  The course focuses on 
a journey – literally and metaphorically – into aspects of Greek (and also world, as defined by 
UNESCO) heritage. We will delve into the past, as a complex and ever-present entity and unravel the 
constituent elements of cultural heritage in contemporary Greece. Among others, we will trace the 
presence and influence of the following: the classical Greeks and the Romans; the Knights; the 
Ottomans; the Italians in the S Aegean islands; the vernacular and its roots; the natural and the 
cultural; current receptions of the past; tourism management and the quest for authenticity in Greek  
 
243 
 
sites and monuments; Greek heritage as it relates to world heritage. The aim of this course is to help 
you form a solid and educated opinion with regard to what constitutes Greek heritage in the 21st 
century as well as how we can all contribute, as educated travelers, to the preservation and 
dissemination of this cultural knowledge. Summer Session. (ARTH 356, ARTH 456)

THE ART AND CRAFT OF CURATING: MAKING SENSE OF ART IN THE 21ST CENTURY. The 
course suggests an inquiry into the world of curating art in the 21st century. The course combines 
theory and history of curating with hands-on experience in curating a project with the instructor’s 
guidance. The term curating is derived from Latin verb curare, which translates as to heal/ to take care 
of/ to attend to. The course unravels the mechanisms through which curators make exhibitions happen 
whether they re-imagine contexts for existing works of art and/ or commission new artworks 
specifically produced/ installed for a show. Emphasis is placed on contemporary art and its curators, 
institutions, premises and principles, starting with the concept of the curatorial. Themes explored are, 
among others, history of museums and art institutions; theories of curating; the relationship between 
curator and artist; the premise of the white cube vs. the re-activation of historical spaces; curator-as-
artist/ artist-as-curator; curator-artist-spectator. With visits to art spaces, from national museums, to 
privately owned galleries, the students will learn first-hand how to curate an exhibition, covering all 
aspects, from coming up with a curatorial concept, to more practical issues, such as fundraising, 
promotion, liaising with artists and galleries, insurance, budget, installing art and all constituent 
elements of a successful show. Fall Semester. (ARTH 386, ARTH 486)

SUSTAINABLE FUTURES: CULTURAL HERITAGE AND TOURISM MANAGEMENT.  This 
course aims at presenting a strong case for the benefits of a rapprochement between cultural heritage 
and tourism studies. Common denominator in both disciplines in the 21st century is the critical issue 
244 
 
of sustainability. The humankind is already on the verge of a new era, according to some, the 
Anthropocene, where the anthropogenic impact is a sweeping force for ecosystems, and when climate 
change is no more a threat but a reality with wide-ranging consequences and a global impact. 
Furthermore, increasing numbers of visitors threaten the authenticity and visibility of cultural heritage 
sites. The course draws from a wide variety of perspectives, critical approaches, theoretical stances 
and case studies to indicate how a constructive dialogue between heritage and tourism experts can 
facilitate a paradigm shift for realistic albeit groundbreaking policies toward a sustainable future.

ethics, and what deeper, philosophical problems (both ethical and political) lie at the source of these 
issues. The main form of business we will be concerned with is the corporate form of business in 
capitalism. The course will formulate and examine the following philosophical problems: 1) The 
philosophical problem of personhood and corporate responsibility, 2) The philosophical problem of 
corporate corruption and crisis, and last 3) The philosophical problem of corporate management and 
happiness.4) The problem of Corporate Citizenship, 5) The problem of Democracy, 6) The problem 
of Justice, 7) The problem of freedom, 8) The problem of Labor, and 9) The problem of the 
Environment.  Finally, this course examines answers to these problems by alternative, radical, activist 
forms of production and exchange of goods. Fall and Spring Semester.  (BUS 350, BUS 450)

COMMUNICATING ACROSS CULTURES. THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CONNECTION. 
This course is about the human element of an increasingly integrated global economy. As 
entrepreneurship continues to boost its international character, people become travelers across 
different sociocultural and economic environments. The goal of business strategies and executives 
alike is to make things work in diverse cultural contexts, having to deal with local rules and 
particularities, habits and processes.  Approaching the field is a multi-disciplinary task. Therefore, this 
course borrows elements from various fields: communications, culture, management and business. It 
adopts a multi-dimensional approach to the subject matter, introducing topics such as cross-cultural 
communication, cultural intelligence, negotiations across cultures, workplace social communication, 
culture in virtual teaming etc.  Management and communication systems and techniques can provide 
solutions and point the way forward. However, the starting point lies within people themselves. Fall

INTERMEDIATE ANCIENT GREEK I: ATTIC PROSE.  Students are introduced to the work of 
writers of the 5th and 4th c. BC.  Consists of the reading of one or more Socratic dialogues in Plato or 
of the most representative speeches of the greatest Attic orators of the period, such as Lysias, 
Isocrates, Antiphon and Demosthenes. In this course students improve their reading skills by 
translating as much Greek as possible. At the same time, we focus on expanding their knowledge of 
the grammar and syntax of the language. Exams in writing, exercises on the board and sight-reading 
are important components. We also examine the author’s language and style in comparison to that of 
contemporary authors. Aspects pertaining to the place of the text in its historical context are also 
discussed: how does the work relate to the events of the period during which it was written, what was 
245 
 
its purpose, does it reflect the values of the society and its people, what values are those, what are the 
author’s political views, and so on. It is the overall purpose of the course not only to improve the 
reading skills of the students but also to make clear the role of the text in the history of Greece and the 
literature produced. Prerequisite:  1 year of Ancient Greek. Fall Semester. (CLAG 201) 
02-223  
INTERMEDIATE ANCIENT GREEK II: HOMER.  The course consists of the reading of selected 
books from The Iliad or The Odyssey; sight-reading and exercises in writing Greek prose complete 
the course.  Prerequisite: 1 year of Ancient Greek.  Spring Semester. (CLAG 202) 
02-313  
ADVANCED ANCIENT GREEK I: THUCYDIDES.  The course includes the reading of one or more 
of the books of The History, and sight-readings of Greek prose and poetry. Prerequisite: 3 semesters 
of Ancient Greek. Fall or Spring Semesters. (CLAG 305) 
02-323  
ADVANCED ANCIENT GREEK II: ATTIC POETRY.  The course is intended to introduce students 
to the work of the great tragedians of the 5th c. BC (Aeschylus, Euripides, Sophocles) or the comedies 
of the most important poet of the Old Attic Comedy, Aristophanes. The course consists of the reading 
of one tragedy or comedy. At the same time, the aim is to expand students’ knowledge of the 
grammar and syntax of the language. Exams in writing, exercises on the board, sight-reading and 
meter exercises are important components of the course. We also examine the author’s language and 
style in comparison to that of contemporary authors. Aspects pertaining to the place of the text in its 
historical context are also taken under consideration: how does the work relate to the events of the 
period during which it was written, what was its purpose, does it reflect the values of the society and 
its people, what values are those, what are the author’s views with regard to contemporary politics, 
and so on. At the end of the semester each student is assigned a role, and the play taught in class is 
presented in front of the entire CYA community. In this way, the students are presented with the 
opportunity not only to improve their language skills but also to “feel” the spirit of the play, the ethics 
of its characters, and its role in the history of Greece and poetry.  Prerequisite: 3 semesters of Greek.

THE GREEK STONES SPEAK: AN INTRODUCTION TO GREEK EPIGRAPHY. This 
introduction to Greek epigraphy offers a practical guide to one of the ancient world’s most interesting 
types of evidence - inscriptions. Texts inscribed on stone and other materials give us insights into 
antiquity that the literary sources cannot, bringing us closer to the ordinary individuals who 
composed, carved and read them. Inscriptions illuminate almost every aspect of the ancient world, 
from the monumental public laws, decrees and royal pronouncements that effected state policies to 
the everyday shopping lists and graffiti scratched on potsherds. The course investigates the origins of 
written Greek, examines a variety of types of texts (decrees, dedications, funerary epitaphs, curses), 
and explores the historical topics which inscriptions inform (democracy, law, empire, literacy and 
bilingualism). Much of the course will be spent on sites and in museums looking at and working with 
inscriptions, especially at the Epigraphic Museum (the world’s largest collection of Greek 
inscriptions), and will include a strong practical element, guiding the student through the skills needed 
to read and interpret both the stones themselves as well as demystifying their publications, opening up 
a wealth of historical, linguistic, and archaeological material. . Prerequisite: Background in ancient 
languages (1-2 semesters of Ancient Greek). Spring Semester. (CLAG 350) 
02-363 
ATTIC PROSE IN TRANSLATION: THUCYDIDES THE ATHENIAN.  The course will involve a 
close reading of the entire work of Thucydides in translation, but key passages will be read and 
analyzed in the original Greek. The focus will be on the author: an Athenian general who had 
participated personally in some of the events that he writes about and held strong opinion about his 
characters. In this way, Thucydides will be understood, not only as a historian, but as a man deeply 
involved in the politics of Athenian Democracy. Prerequisite: Background in ancient languages (1-2 
semesters of Ancient Greek).  Fall Semester. (CLAG 351) 
02-383 
THE ILIAD OF HOMER.  The course involves a close reading of the Iliad (in translation) and 
constitutes an in-depth exploration of several aspects of the poem, historical, psychological, and 
religious. To begin with the historical setting, the daunting ruins of Troy are viewed as a monument 
that inspired the poet in the seventh century BCE - not earlier. This was a time when the Assyrian 
empire was expanding and Greek soldiers were employed as mercenaries in the Near East and Egypt. 
The possibility that Homer saw these ruins in person is investigated. Emphasis will be placed on the 
analysis of the psychology of the characters: the plight of soldiers fighting far away from their 
country, the guilt of a woman who betrayed her husband, the dark side of pride and egocentrism that 
may lead to madness. Homer includes animals in his enormous literary canvass:  the fear of a timid 
hare seeing a predator approaching matches the fear of a soldier walking resolutely to his death. The 
course finally explores the religious dimension of the poem: do the gods in the Iliad really exist or are 
they figments of human imagination? The poet allows his readers to make up their own minds, but 
246 
 
makes sure that the epiphany of a god is never witnessed by more than one person. His unique grasp 
of the predicament of man as a helpless but heroic creature in lawful but loveless universe makes the 
Iliad one of the best poems ever to have been written.  All texts are in translation. Spring Semester.

INTERMEDIATE LATIN I.  This course introduces students to the most representative work of the 
Roman comic playwright, T. Maccius Plautus (d.184 BCE). Although his Latin is somewhat archaic, 
it is quite simple and easy to translate. The course aims to improve students' reading skills and at the 
same time expand their knowledge of Latin grammar and syntax. Students also examine the author's 
language and style, and discuss his texts in their historical context. Prerequisite: 1 year of Latin.  Fall

Communications – COMM  (CYA) 
15-333, 15-433 
SCIENCE COMMUNICATION. This course is going to provide both a practical and a theoretical 
approach to science communication. Communicating effectively scientific results is an essential skill 
nowadays since it can lead to fruitful collaborations and result in obtaining an important amount of 
funding (as public engagement is a key factor in every researcher’s application for a grant) that can 
help develop further any scientific project. More importantly, it can positively impact society by 
increasing the Science Capital, promoting scientific literacy, and hence fighting pseudoscience and 
the lack of trust of the public towards scientists. The main purpose of the course is to highlight the 
importance of effective science communication and present the various ways through which it can 
have a positive long-lasting influence on a wide range of audiences (such as creating collaborations 
on an academic level, building trust with the general public and inspiring young school students to 
follow STEM related subjects at school and later at the University). In more detail, the students will 
learn how to share key findings and results from different research groups at NCSR “Demokritos” and 
measure the impact this communication can have on society and the research center. This means the 
students will first familiarize themselves with the scientific method and the different types of 
scientific research on different topics (such as lab work in nanoscience or theoretical work in nuclear 
physics), they will then learn how to share this information with different audiences. Lastly, in order 
for their work to be meaningful, they will evaluate their projects and measure the impact it has. Spring

MEDIATING THE MESSAGE: SOCIAL MEDIA AND PEOPLE (IN GREECE). Social Media (or 
Social Networks) constitute the spear of the Writable Web that is causing massive changes in 
traditional mediating models. Human and institutional communication is going through tremendous 
change, with individual wisdom directly competing with mass media operations. Peer online activity 
and shared material create multiple instances of media experiences for users who are engaged in a 
constant selection process, either browsing on a homepage of an online newspaper or through 
Facebook posts. Traditional media, despite their heavy online investments are challenged in terms of 
their role as leading intermediaries between institutional sources and society. Studies have suggested 
that peer-shared material via deep links to websites constitute a significant point of entry for an 
increasing population of social network users, who tend to ignore pre-arranged syntheses of news 
stories on mainstream homepages. THE GREEK CASE: During the crisis years in Greece, online 
public dialogue has experienced a substantial growth, not only amongst people, but also between 
audiences and established media that, increasingly see news content being put under scrutiny by 
producers-users (or producers), who are active online. Traditional political forces have similar 
experiences, trying to keep up with developments. During the crisis years in Greece, social media 
users/voters have boosted political discourse via social networks, contributing, sharing or 
commenting on on-going developments. At the same time, crisis at a political level has caused the 
disintegration of old political formations accompanied by the demise of, until then, dominant political 
247 
 
rhetoric and messaging systems. Social media functions of mainstream politics remained in the 
margins of creativity, playing a minimal role amongst potential voters. Spring Semester. (COMM

COMMUNICATING ACROSS CULTURES. THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CONNECTION. 
This course is about the human element of an increasingly integrated global economy. As 
entrepreneurship continues to boost its international character, people become travelers across 
different sociocultural and economic environments. The goal of business strategies and executives 
alike is to make things work in diverse cultural contexts, having to deal with local rules and 
particularities, habits and processes.  Approaching the field is a multi-disciplinary task. Therefore, this 
course borrows elements from various fields: communications, culture, management and business. It 
adopts a multi-dimensional approach to the subject matter, introducing topics such as cross-cultural 
communication, cultural intelligence, negotiations across cultures, workplace social communication, 
culture in virtual teaming etc.  Management and communication systems and techniques can provide 
solutions and point the way forward. However, the starting point lies within people themselves. Fall

21-313, 21-413  
PHOTOGRAPHY AND ARCHAEOLOGY: THE ART OF DOCUMENTATION.  The study of the 
relationship between photography and archaeology requires a multi-disciplinary approach. We must 
be practitioners and theorists, researchers and analysts, approaching archaeological photography from 
a variety of angles. Through lectures and viewing the work of major figures in the field, you will 
become familiar with the development of the medium alongside the discipline of archaeology. 
Through site visits and hands-on experience with specialized equipment, you will gain insight into the 
mechanics of photography and how it shapes vision. Through examining case studies and conducting 
your own research, you will discover how photography has often held up a mirror to the greater 
cultural contexts of archaeology. Spring Semester. (CHTE 323, CHTE 423) 
21-343, 21-443  
SUSTAINABLE FUTURES: CULTURAL HERITAGE AND TOURISM MANAGEMENT.  This 
course aims at presenting a strong case for the benefits of a rapprochement between cultural heritage 
and tourism studies. Common denominator in both disciplines in the 21st century is the critical issue 
of sustainability. The humankind is already on the verge of a new era, according to some, the 
Anthropocene, where the anthropogenic impact is a sweeping force for ecosystems, and when climate 
change is no more a threat but a reality with wide-ranging consequences and a global impact. 
Furthermore, increasing numbers of visitors threaten the authenticity and visibility of cultural heritage 
sites. The course draws from a wide variety of perspectives, critical approaches, theoretical stances 
and case studies to indicate how a constructive dialogue between heritage and tourism experts can 
facilitate a paradigm shift for realistic albeit groundbreaking policies toward a sustainable future.

PLUNDERING GREEK ANTIQUITY: COLLECTORS, MUSEUMS, AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL 
ETHICS.  Who owns the Greek past? Where do the Parthenon Marbles belong and why? Where do 
Cycladic figurines come from, and why do we know so little about most of them? Is the Getty Kouros 
an authentic Greek statue? Can we use science to answer this question? If the Euphronios Krater was 
made in Greece, why is it in Italy (after more than thirty years in the US)? Is looting still happening in 
Greece? We will contemplate these and other questions in our discussion of the broad range of ethical 
dilemmas connected to Greek antiquities in the 21st century. We will focus on issues concerning the 
looting of ancient sites; ethical, political, and legal aspects of the international trade in art objects and 
antiquities; authenticity and forgery of ancient art and the scientific technologies applied in the 
analysis of ancient objects; the management of museums and repatriation of cultural property; 
conservation and preservation of cultural heritage; and the protection of cultural property in armed 
conflict. No previous knowledge of Greek art and archaeology is required. Summer Session. (CHTE

THE PRESENT PAST: RE-IMAGINING GREECE THROUGH HERITAGE.  The course focuses on 
a journey – literally and metaphorically – into aspects of Greek (and also world, as defined by 
UNESCO) heritage. We will delve into the past, as a complex and ever-present entity and unravel the 
constituent elements of cultural heritage in contemporary Greece. Among others, we will trace the 
presence and influence of the following: the classical Greeks and the Romans; the Knights; the 
Ottomans; the Italians in the S Aegean islands; the vernacular and its roots; the natural and the 
cultural; current receptions of the past; tourism management and the quest for authenticity in Greek 
sites and monuments; Greek heritage as it relates to world heritage. The aim of this course is to help 
you form a solid and educated opinion with regard to what constitutes Greek heritage in the 21st 
century as well as how we can all contribute, as educated travelers, to the preservation and 
dissemination of this cultural knowledge. Summer Session. (CHTE 356, CHTE 456) 
21-333, 21-433  
THE ART AND CRAFT OF CURATING: MAKING SENSE OF ART IN THE 21ST CENTURY The 
course suggests an inquiry into the world of curating art in the 21st century. The course combines 
theory and history of curating with hands-on experience in curating a project with the instructor’s 
guidance. The term curating is derived from Latin verb curare, which translates as to heal/ to take care 
of/ to attend to. The course unravels the mechanisms through which curators make exhibitions happen 
whether they re-imagine contexts for existing works of art and/ or commission new artworks 
specifically produced/ installed for a show. Emphasis is placed on contemporary art and its curators, 
institutions, premises and principles, starting with the concept of the curatorial. Themes explored are, 
among others, history of museums and art institutions; theories of curating; the relationship between 
curator and artist; the premise of the white cube vs. the re-activation of historical spaces; curator-as-
artist/ artist-as-curator; curator-artist-spectator. With visits to art spaces, from national museums, to 
privately owned galleries, the students will learn first-hand how to curate an exhibition, covering all 
aspects, from coming up with a curatorial concept, to more practical issues, such as fundraising, 
promotion, liaising with artists and galleries, insurance, budget, installing art and all constituent 
elements of a successful show. Fall Semester. (CHTE 386, CHTE 486)

EUROPE TODAY: WINTER IS COMING  The first part of the course will be devoted to analyzing 
the accomplishments and distinctiveness of the European Union as an institution, focusing on 
achievements such as the single market (that allows citizens to live, study, work and retire in any state 
of the Union), the development of a “social Europe” (with universal healthcare, public higher 
education and strong welfare states), and the commitment to the promotion of democracy, human 
rights and gender equality. The focus will be on appreciating how the European Union has been the 
driver of an unprecedented “peace project” that has made allies out of former enemies and has helped 
avert war on the continent for 70 years, after centuries of wars and bloodshed.  When the 
contributions of the European Union are evaluated, the Peace dividend is often taken for granted. 
The second part will focus on new and ongoing challenges facing Europe, including the deep 
repercussions of the departure of the United Kingdom from the Union, the impact of the refugee/ 
migration crisis, the growth of Euroscepticism and authoritarianism, the rise of radical Islam and the 
perceived “clash of civilizations”. The ongoing Covid-19 crisis, which has had a profoundly 
detrimental impact on the economic, political, and social systems of all EU countries and has tested 
European solidarity, will also be examined. 
The third part will address the European Union’s changing place in the world by examining new and 
evolving geopolitical linkages, traditional alliances and rivalries, and evolving bilateral relationships 
with the United States, Russia, China et al. Special attention will be given to the growing challenges 
in the immediate neighborhood, i.e. the Middle East, the Mediterranean basin, Turkey, and the 
Western Balkans. The analysis will be framed within the context of the debate on the future of the EU 
and its role in global and regional affairs.

Finally, at the end of the semester the students will participate in a simulation game where they will 
apply the knowledge they have gained about the policies and international relations of the European 
Union. The students will be assigned roles representing EU institutions, EU Member States, third-
party stakeholders or press corps and will negotiate a collective European response to an international 
crisis affecting the European Union. Fall and Spring Semesters. (ECON 327, ECON 427)

PLAGUE, POLITICS, & POPULISM:CLASSICAL TO MODERN (ATHENS, DELPHI, DELOS, 
MYKONOS) Drawing from ancient texts and modern scholarship, visits to archeological and cultural 
sites in Athens, Delphi and Delos, as well as private meetings with leading academics, business 
experts, NGOs, and government bodies, this course will explore how ancient and modern epidemics – 
specifically the Great Plague of Athens in 430 BC and COVID-19 Pandemic – expose the “fissures 
and fractures” that intensify and foment the economic and political consequences of their respective 
eras. In the case of fifth-century Athens, the plague ultimately cost the city-state a victory against 
Sparta, questioned the leadership of Pericles, and killed a third of the population amidst a climate rife 
with conspiracy theories, rising populism, and xenophobia. Events that seeded the decline of Athenian 
hegemony, and democracy. The comparison to similar patterns emerging today is inescapable, as is 
the expectation that COVID-19 will reshape history for decades to come. With profound economic 
and political uncertainty escalating, students will address contemporary challenges facing Greece and 
Europe, thrashed against the prism of Athenian antecedents. During the first two weeks, students will 
consider the Great Plague’s impact on the political economy of Athens, from the accounts of 
Thucydides, Plato, Greek political thinkers and playwrights, as well as the scholarship of Bresson, 
Kelaidis, and Ober among others. During the second two weeks, these insights and arguments will be 
applied to analyzing how Greece continues battling COVID-19 against the backdrop of decades-long 
economic, political, and social crises. This will include examining (in non-technical terms) both the 
microeconomic impact on households, commerce, and governments, and macroeconomic impact on 
GDP, growth initiatives, and public policy. This framework will challenge students to synthesize all 
course resources, and advance their understanding of Greece and Europe’s role in the future of 
globalization. Summer Session. (ECON 343).

THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT OF GREECE. A unique review of the natural world and wildlife 
of Greece through an exploration of its lands and seas with reference to humankind’s effects on the 
environment through the ages. The course uses a multidisciplinary approach to study physical and 
human geography, biodiversity, and historical ecology. Through a succession of guided excursions in 
and around Athens, students are able to interpret landscape features and processes and develop skills 
in identifying the region’s rich flora and fauna. Interpreting natural history promotes a better 
awareness of the environment and current conservation problems in modern Greece.  Spring

CULTURAL LANDSCAPES.  Landscape studies bring together nature and culture to form a holistic 
interpretation of local natural history. This course presents the landscape approach through 
interdisciplinary research and field work. It provides an introduction to landscape-based study and its 
applications, the main goal being to build an appreciation for landscape literacy.  The course 
objectives are: a) the understanding and use of basic notions and terms in landscape studies and the 
values of their use; b) Familiarization with the basic methods of landscape analysis, assessment and 
evaluation techniques; c) Getting to know the cultural landscapes of Greece with special emphasis on 
the history of their development; and d) having students develop a landscape analysis application 
during their research in Greece. Fall Semester. (ENVR 353, ENVR 453)

250 
 
development theory and practice. In order to problematize the relevant discussion and connect it with 
the production of urban space we will analyze case studies in Athens and attempt to unpack the 
contradictions that are connected with urban development and the use of natural resources in the last 
decades and during the current crisis.  Fall semester. (ENVR 370, ENVR 470)

DEVELOPMENT OF ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY.  This course examines the emergence and 
unfolding of the political institutions of Athenian democracy to the end of the 5th c. BC. Its focus is 
primarily on the Age of Pericles, when Athenian democracy reached the point of its highest 
development, a period generally acknowledged as being one of the greatest moments in world history. 
The political institutions of the period are examined against their historical background and on the 
basis of the study of primary sources (i.e. the reading and interpretation of literary sources, visits to 
archaeological sites and museums, the study and interpretation of inscriptions and other 
archaeological evidence). Fall or Spring Semesters. (HIST 311, HIST 411)

LIFE & DEATH IN ANCIENT GREECE & EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN: AN INTRO TO 
ATHENIAN SOCIETY  his course takes a sociological and anthropological approach to ancient 
Athenian society, focusing on the individual and examining the human journey through the rites and 
rituals surrounding birth, transitional phases, marriage, family and kinship, illness and death. We will 
examine the role of religion in all aspects of the ancient city; explore the political relationships that 
bound Athenians together; watch them at the gymnasium and in sports and athletic contexts within 
different age classes; see how they join the workforce in the household, factories or shops, and how 
the economy of the city was organize as well as delve into their private lives at home. A holistic 
approach to all aspects of society will bring to the fore the many groups who have traditionally been 
marginalized in scholarship: children, women, servants, enslaved peoples, foreigners and refugees in 
the city. To gather evidence for this analysis of ancient life, we will visit a number of archaeological 
sites and museums around Athens.  Fall Semester. (HIST 334, HIST 434)

CONTEMP GREEK POLITICS & SOCIETY. Cast in a comparative framework designed to render 
Greek society and political system more readily intelligible to the average American undergraduate, 
the course explores the history of the modern Greek state in search of insights and interpretative keys 
that might shed light on the country’s current crisis. A salient feature of the course is an examination 
of the central role that the "foreign factor" has played in Greek politics from the early 19th century 
until today. Equally important is the historical investigation of Greek national identity--its different 
sources and strands--in an attempt to explain the sudden growth of anti-immigrant, xenophobic and 
ultra-nationalist sentiments. Class sessions are supplemented by a visit to the Greek Parliament where 
students have the opportunity to talk with leading politicians, a walking tour of Athens, and the 
screening of select Greek movies.  Fall Semester. (HIST 339, HIST 439)

HEALTH & HEALING IN THE ANCIENT GREEK WORLD. The course focuses on the ancient 
Greek experience of health and healing from the Archaic through the Hellenistic era, as presented in a 
number of key texts and in the material or archaeological record. A central project will be discovering 
and understanding the contemporaneous emergence and continued success of both Hippocratic 
medicine and Asclepian religion/cult, two distinct but related ways of thinking about health and 
healing. Ten days on the island of Kos, the birthplace of Hippocrates and the site of one of most 
beautiful sanctuaries of Asclepius, will bring us directly into engagement with the two approaches to 
health and disease, while days spent in Athens will give us the chance to visit the site of Athenian 
sanctuary of Asclepius on the south slope of the Acropolis and also view the many artifacts from that 
sanctuary now in the National Archaeological and New Acropolis museums. Summer Session. (HIST

how the ancient Greek and Roman sources perceived the “Others” who lived on the edges of their 
political and cultural empires.  What can we learn if we shift our position and stand outside, across the 
border looking in? This course tries to answer this question, using an emphasis on both ancient 
sources and material culture combined, to provide an in-depth examination of the various types of 
cultural interactions that occurred along the borders of the Graeco-Roman world. It provides a critical 
examination of the Greek and Roman ideologies of multiculturalism, and how these were received 
and/or resisted by the indigenous populations who were subjected to them. In doing so we will try to 
reconstruct the experiences of living on the frontiers of two of the most powerful empires in history: 
the benefits, the violences, the ambivalences, and more. Fall and Spring Semesters. (HIST 341, HIST

MAKING LOVE AND WAR IN THE MEDIEVAL MEDITERRANEAN: CROSS-CULTURAL 
ENCOUNTERS IN THE MIDDLE AND LATE BYZANTINE PERIODS.  This course will take a 
comparative approach to cross-cultural encounters in the Mediterranean from the tenth to the fifteenth 
centuries, combining readings in a variety of genres (historiography, romance, novel, saint’s lives, 
crusader narratives, and others) alongside readings drawn from recent scholarship and complemented 
by site visits to help students understand the many ways in which rising and falling empires interacted 
with one another through war, travel, trade, and diplomacy. As narratives of cross-cultural encounters 
across space and social strata, readings in these genres allow for an exploration of a variety of central 
issues in considering the late Byzantine period, including political issues such as imperial conquest, 
social issues such as the rights of women, and more intimate issues, such as cross-cultural romance.

DIVERSITY|DIFFERENCE|REGIONALITY AMONG GREEKSTATES (ATHENS, 
PELOPONNESE, N. GREECE, THASSOS).  The weight of Classical texts about Athens or by 
Athenians has led to a concentration on this one ancient polis, an Athenocentricity that needs to be 
balanced by the archaeological record across the rest of the ancient Greece world. Was Athens the 
typical polis, the norm, the exemplar, or quite unique? Did other Greek states behave like the 
Athenians in their cultural, religious, or political lives? Did all Greeks have the same norms and 
taboos concerning gender, sex and sexuality? These questions and many others will be explored 
during this intensive 4-week tour of Greece, which will cover many regions of the country in order to 
bring out the local differences in material culture, literary and epigraphic traditions, and 
archaeological remains. We will visit archaeological sites and museums and use the evidence 
presented to discuss issues of race, ethnicity, social structures, language and communication, war, 
politics, slavery, and religion. Summer Session. (HIST 346)

IN THE AEGEAN  Was there life in Greece after the Classics? What happened to the Greek lands 
after the Classical period and until Early Modern times? Who were the Byzantines and why did they 
call themselves Romans? And if Byzantines identified themselves as Romans, then who were the 
Latins from Italy, France, and the rest of Western Europe who conquered much of Greece in the 13th 
century? Did you know that an Islamic Emirate ruled much of the Aegean for two centuries? And that 
many place names even in the south most of Greece originate from the Slavic language spoken by 
migrating population in these areas in the early Middle Ages? Or that the Ottoman sultan in 15th c. 
Istanbul was regarded by many Greek-speaking as the continuation of the Byzantine emperor? Fall

ALTERNATIVE HISTORIES: JEWISH GREEKS AND THE MODERN NATION.  The course 
focuses on the experiences of Jews living in the Greek nation-state during the 19th and 20th centuries. 
It is structured around a core issue: The encounter of pre-national Jewish identities with the 
exigencies of a new, ‘modern’ at the time idea, namely that of a common Greek national identity.  
This encounter was part of the wider transition from the era of empires to that of nation-states. And it 
was not an easy encounter. Since the formation of the Greek state in the 19th century, Greek-Orthodox 
religion has been conceived as one of the main components of Greek national and cultural identity, 
binding together the expanding new-born nation-state. Nevertheless, being the heir of the multi-
religious Ottoman Empire where Greek-Orthodox Christians lived alongside Muslims, Jews, and 
Christians of different denominations, the Greek state that emerged out of the Ottoman Empire had to 
take up the challenge of dealing with this non-Orthodox population that came included in its 
territories.  The course will thus follow this encounter focusing primarily but not exclusively on two 
aspects: a) on the policies that the Greek state adopted in order to «manage» the Jewish populations 
that were being gradually added in its territory; and b) on the reactions that the Jews living in the  
 
252 
 
various communities had in front of the new exigencies of the Greek state; reactions that covered the 
whole spectrum from assimilation to migration.  The study of the Jews in Greece will be also framed 
by case-studies of other non-Orthodox Greeks, tracing the responses that they devised in order to 
articulate their plural identities combining non-Orthodox religious and cultural elements with the idea 
of a common, unique Greek national identity. The course will close by briefly examining the 
redefinition of “Greekness” after new immigrant populations reached Greece in the post-WWII era. 
Understanding how Jews and more generally people of different creeds and origin devised alternative 
versions of “Greekness”, which undermined the intimate connection between religious and national 
identity, is more than relevant today that nation states and their supposed homogeneity is seriously 
challenged by the waves of global migration, forcing us to reflect anew on forms and definitions of 
belonging. Spring Semester. (HIST 349, HIST 449)

AMERICANS & THE GREEK REVOLUTION: FROM PHILHELLENES TO ABOLITIONISTS.  
The outbreak of the Greek revolution of 1821 against Ottoman rule made a deep impression on 
Americans. This course examines the wide-ranging forms of support Americans offered the Greeks, 
including calls on the government to recognize Greece, creating a broad-based philhellenic movement 
that raised funds for the rebels; and for a few,  crossing the Atlantic to fight as volunteers on the side 
of the Greeks. We will explore the causes of this early American philhellenism: an education based on 
the Classics; the liberal content of the Greek uprising that echoed 1776; the religious impulse of 
supporting  fellow Christians fighting for freedom; and a humanitarian empathy toward a people who 
faced death or being sold into slavery. We will also examine how the philhellenic movement 
legitimized the involvement in public affairs of ordinary Americans, especially women, and how it 
contributed to the growth of the abolitionist movement in Antebellum America.  Fall Semester. (HIST

SPORTS, GAMES & SPECTACLES IN THE GRACO-ROMAN WORLD.  The main aim of this 
course is to explore the emergence and development of both athletic competitions and sports-based 
games and spectacles from the Bronze Age through to the period of late antiquity. Within this wider 
spatial and temporal context, it focuses on two separate thematic entities: Ancient Greek Athletics, 
with particular attention to the development and evolution of the main Ancient Greek athletic events 
over the ages, and an in-depth investigation of Roman public spectacles and gladiatorial games. 
Drawing on a variety of disciplines and available (primary) sources, from history and archaeology to 
modern sports studies and social psychology, the course primarily seeks to examine the main purpose 
and function of these games and spectacles within the wider social, political, religious, cultural and 
intellectual context of the times, as well as their overall significance in the daily lives of the ancients. 
A secondary aim of this course is to explore how archaeologists and historians analyze primary 
sources to determine their veracity and reliability. To this end, we'll be looking at re-creations and 
experiments that have been conducted, as well as conducting many of our own, to create a hands-on 
and thus better understanding of these athletic activities. We will also look at how ancient sports and 
spectacles have been represented in contemporary popular culture, to test our gained knowledge 
against the images produced by Hollywood and elsewhere. In addition to in-class lectures and 
discussions, the course also includes a substantial on-site teaching component, with field trips to 
archaeological sites and museums of athletic significance (such as Olympia, Isthmia, Nemea, Delphi 
and Messene) where sessions center on the examination and interpretation of the physical evidence.

ANCIENT MACEDON. An examination of the actions and events of the 4th c. through the study of 
primary evidence - literary, epigraphic and archaeological. Special attention is paid to the career of 
Philip II and to that of his son Alexander the Great. The course is partly taught on the field trip to 
Northern Greece which takes students to Thessaloniki and its museums,  the ancient capital city of 
Pella, the royal Macedonian tombs, the palace at Vergina and other sites with a view to familiarize the 
students with the archaeological evidence on Macedonian history. A visit to the Epigraphic Museum 
in Athens acquaints students with important 4th c. documents that survive inscribed on stones and 
which constitute valuable sources of ancient history. Special emphasis is given to topics that are 
central to modern political and intellectual debate. Spring Semester. (HIST 356, HIST 456)

BIOGRAPHY OF AN EMPIRE: THE SURPRISING LIFE OF ‘BYZANTIUM’ (324-1453). The 
course is an introduction to the history of the Byzantine Empire (284/324-1453). The first unit 
explores the transformation of the Ancient World and the emergence of the Byzantine Empire as a 
major political, economic, and cultural power in Europe and the Near East, from Diocletian’s re-
foundation of the Roman Empire (284-305) and Constantine’s re-foundation of the city of 
Byzantium/New Rome (324) until the end of the 12th century. Among the topics covered in this unit  
 
253 
 
are the development of imperial ideology and the institutions of the state; warfare and diplomacy; 
social and economic life, and literary, artistic, and architectural achievements. The second unit 
examines the period between the Latin and the Ottoman Conquests of Constantinople (1203/1204 and 
1453) and the shaping of the historical memory of Byzantium from the Late Middle Ages to today, 
and ends with an introduction to the Medieval history and monuments of the Peloponnese and the 
school field trip to the region. A major theme of this second unit is Byzantium as perceived in 
Western arts (literature, theatre, cinema, opera, music, photography, painting and sculpture), in order 
to better understand the mechanisms of (re)construction of historical memory through the analysis of 
different interpretations of particular historical events. The course pays particular attention to Athens 
and the Peloponnese in its use of examples and case histories covering many aspects of medieval 
history (the Crusades and the rise of Islam), art and architecture and along with a focus on the 
religious aspects. The course should be very useful for students majoring in these subjects as well as 
those in modern history & religious studies. Fall Semester.  (HIST 359, HIST 459)

WHO IS A GREEK? POLITICS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY IN MODERN GREECE.  This course 
aims to explore the historical trajectory of this question illustrating how political and social priorities 
shaped diverse responses over time. The main goal is to understand that being a Greek, and the 
criteria that confirmed this over time, is not a strict legal category, but rather a flexible ideological 
concept. Fall and Spring Semester. (HIST 365, HIST 465)

THE GREEK JEWS: HISTORY, IDENTITY & MEMORY.  This course explores the history of the 
Greek Jews from 1821 to the present, focusing on: their rich cultural and religious traditions; 
communal life; incorporation into Greek society and the events that shaped their lives - including the 
Holocaust and its remembrance. The Greek Jews include primarily two communities, the Romaniotes 
and the Sephardim. The Romaniotes have been present in the Greek lands for centuries and are 
considered the oldest Jewish community in Europe. The Sephardic Jews settled in the Greek lands 
after their expulsion from Spain in 1492. Their large concentration in Salonica -present-day 
Thessaloniki- made the city known as “Mother of Israel.” The course studies the evolution of this 
extraordinary blend of Jewish history and culture, its place in Greek society, the devastation endured 
in the Holocaust, and its survival and memorialization in present-day Greece and Israel.  Spring

TO THE STRONGEST: ANCIENT NEAR EAST.  The conquests of Alexander the Great, which 
brought under Macedonian rule the regions of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Persia, up to the borders with 
India, had a profound impact on the future course of the history of the Near East. Through the study 
of primary sources, both literary and archaeological, this course explores the long history of 
interaction between the Greco-Roman world and that of its Near Eastern counterpart and the 
significant influence this interaction had on the formation and development of a common cultural, 
religious, and political identity, which modern scholars have labeled “Hellenistic”.  Within this 
perspective, our main focus is on the investigation of particular aspects of Near Eastern civilization: 
the emergence of new cultural and social institutions, new forms of economic life, and the creation, 
fusion, and amalgamation of religious institutions (to which this course gives a special emphasis). The 
main purpose of the course is to provide significant insight into an often neglected and yet very 
important and formative era in world history, the Hellenistic period. Fall Semester. (HIST 368, HIST

ANCIENT HISTORY: SOURCES AND METHODS.  Ancient History: Sources and Methods: This 
course offers an overview of the literary and archaeological evidence for ancient history, particularly 
for the writing of Greece’s past, and the methodologies of how to treat and analyze primary and 
secondary sources. We will focus on the writings and methods of a number of leading Greek 
historians in order to understand how they crafted their works and dealt with historical enquiry and 
will also examine the wider field of ancient historiography by investigating the writings of historians 
preserved only in fragments and looking at historical documents in papyri and inscriptions. We will 
then investigate how these ancient works have been used by historians from the Renaissance to the 
present in creating a picture of the ancient world, exploring their own methodologies and ideologies 
from Marxism to the Neocons. Fall Semester. (HIST 418)

SCIENCE COMMUNICATION. This course is going to provide both a practical and a theoretical 
approach to science communication. Communicating effectively scientific results is an essential skill 
nowadays since it can lead to fruitful collaborations and result in obtaining an important amount of 
funding (as public engagement is a key factor in every researcher’s application for a grant) that can 
help develop further any scientific project. More importantly, it can positively impact society by 
increasing the Science Capital, promoting scientific literacy, and hence fighting pseudoscience and 
the lack of trust of the public towards scientists. The main purpose of the course is to highlight the 
importance of effective science communication and present the various ways through which it can 
have a positive long-lasting influence on a wide range of audiences (such as creating collaborations 
on an academic level, building trust with the general public and inspiring young school students to 
follow STEM related subjects at school and later at the University). In more detail, the students will 
learn how to share key findings and results from different research groups at NCSR “Demokritos” and 
measure the impact this communication can have on society and the research center. This means the 
students will first familiarize themselves with the scientific method and the different types of 
scientific research on different topics (such as lab work in nanoscience or theoretical work in nuclear 
physics), they will then learn how to share this information with different audiences. Lastly, in order 
for their work to be meaningful, they will evaluate their projects and measure the impact it has. Spring

GREEK THEATER: ANCIENT AND MODERN This course will study and interpret ancient Greek 
drama both in its original context and as it is adapted and performed around the world today. The 
course will examine the origins and cultural context of Greek drama, as well as the performative 
aspects of the plays: theatrical space, stagecraft, music, and dance. It will also focus on key issues that 
the plays are concerned with, especially gender conflict, personal and communal identity, human 
violence, human and divine justice, self-sacrifice, political ambition, and the roles of women, slaves, 
and foreigners. In addition to studying the ancient texts, students will explore the relevance of these 
plays in later times, from the renaissance to today and will examine contemporary adaptations and 
projects based on these plays, especially ones that focus on identity, women, immigrants, veterans of 
war, and violence. Fall Semesters. (LIT 325, LIT 425)

MYTH AND RECEPTION offers an in-depth exploration of a selection of important Greek 
mythological stories and figures as represented in Greek and Roman literature, and a focused 
examination of the reception of these myths in the visual and performing arts. During the course 
students will become proficient in a variety of methods of analysis and interpretation of these myths; 
critically engage with select scholarship; and study the role of myth in helping individuals and 
communities organize their understanding of the world. Through research, writing, and oral 
presentations, as well as daily in-class analysis, students will engage with key issues treated by the 
myths: these include gender conflict, personal and communal identity, the consequences of war, 
human and divine justice, self-sacrifice, political ambition, and the societal roles of women, slaves, 
and foreigners. The course treats not only the ancient material, but also the way in which these myths 
have been received in modern times, and rendered into artwork, theatrical performances, opera, and 
dance pieces. Students will thus gain a deeper understanding of the relevance of these myths for 
society today. Fall and Spring Semesters. (LIT 328, LIT 428)

BECOMING A TRAVELER: WRITING IN GREECE. Through creative nonfiction the course uses 
Greece as a lens to examine the ways writers draw on Greece’s rich myths, history, and literary 
traditions. It explores questions that arise when writing about place and travel. In what ways do our 
expectations and our actual perceptions merge into a narrative? And how do outsiders’ perspectives 
contribute to the literary composition and creation of place? Students work on crafting and analyzing 
nonfiction prose that is reflective, lyrical and/or investigative, and that borrows rhetorical elements 
from fiction and poetry. Summer Session. (LIT 348, LIT 448) 
07-313, 07-413  
ATTIC TRAGEDY (IN TRANSLATION). This course is intended to introduce students to the work 
of the great tragedians of the 5th c. BC (Aeschylus, Euripides, Sophocles). From the end of the Persian 
Wars to the battle of Aegospotami, the Athenian state flourished in an unprecedented way that 
marked the history of the western world. It is in this time frame that tragedy emerged as the 
culmination of the literary tradition of the 8th-6th c BC and the product of the prosperity of the “golden 
era” of Athens. Thus, the plays of Aeschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles are both a fascinating way 
into the wider political, social and religious culture of 5th c. Athens and a rich part of an important 
tool for the study of theater in antiquity and nowadays. The plays are analyzed with respect to the 
author’s language and style and in comparison to contemporary authors. At the same time, they are 
being considered in their literary, cultural, intellectual, and historical contexts, and the following 
questions are addressed: what was Attic tragedy; how and why did it emerge; what were the 
mechanisms of theatrical production in ancient Greece; how did the plays relate to the events of the 
fifth century; did they reflect social values, and what values were those; what is the impact of ancient 
tragedy on modern culture; what is its relevance and value in the theater today, and so on. To answer 
these questions, the course examines closely a number of plays and students discuss them with the aid 
of modern scholarship. No previous knowledge is required, and all texts will be studied in translation.

CONSCIOUSNESS.  Consciousness has been considered one of great mysteries in human existence. 
Historically, psychologists and neuroscientists have largely ignored the problem of conscious 
awareness because it was considered subjective, falling outside the realm of scientific inquiry. 
However, over the past several decades scientists have begun to try to tackle the problem using 
modern scientific tools. In fact, several years ago, a new journal was established entitled 
Neuroscience of Consciousness. In this course, we will begin by trying to define the term and 
consider the so-called “hard” and “easy” problems of consciousness. A brief history of ancient 
civilizations’ views on mental experience will be discussed with particular attention to Greek thinkers 
from the classical period. We will then go over basic neuroscientific concepts and methods that are 
being used to study the neural correlates of consciousness. We will explore different states of 
consciousness and disruptions of consciousness in human patients. We will touch on the related 
problems of intentionality and free will. Finally, we will discuss prevailing scientific theories of 
consciousness. Fall Semester.  (NSCI 342, NSCI 442)

BUSINESS, ETHICS AND POLITICS.  This course examines some of the standard issues in business 
ethics, and deeper, philosophical problems (both ethical and political) THAT lie at the source of these 
issues. The main form of business we will be concerned with is the corporate form of business in 
capitalism. The course will formulate and examine the following philosophical problems: 1) The 
philosophical problem of personhood and corporate responsibility, 2) The philosophical problem of 
corporate corruption and crisis, and last 3) The philosophical problem of corporate management and 
happiness.4) The problem of Corporate Citizenship, 5) The problem of Democracy, 6) The problem

WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER? INTRODUCTION TO TRANSHUMANISM. Transhumanism 
developed as a philosophy that became a cultural movement and is now regarded as a growing field of 
study. It is a complex mix of philosophical anthropology and philosophy of technology that brings 
together diverse problems from various fields such as philosophy, social sciences, cultural studies, 
neuroscience, information science, biomedical science, molecular biology and artificial intelligence. 
Transhumanism aims at modifying and upgrading human beings through technology claiming that 
biological evolution is incomplete and without direction. Although it adopts elements of humanism 
such as rationality, self-knowledge, self-care, autonomy and self-creation it does so with reference to 
the ideal of the creation of a new human species. The aim of the seminar is to provide an overview of 
transhumanism by examining a) its historical roots, core values, goals and principles and b) its moral, 
political and aesthetic aspects. Fall and Spring Semesters. (PHIL 351, PHIL 451)

THE CONCEPT OF LIFE IN ANCIENT GREEK PHILOSOPHY & ITS RELEVANCE TODAY. In 
the first part, the course explores the first systematic account of the concept of life which is 
Aristotle’s. To do this students examine Aristotle’s understanding of nature as having its own ends, 
his distinction between genus and as species, his account of the logic of life and his distinction 
between forms of life [vegetative(plants), sensitive(animals), rational(humans)]. In the second part 
students see that the concept of life plays a crucial role in the formation of the ancient Greek 
philosophy of ethics, politics and culture, and that this philosophy of life is both an influence and an 
alternative to modern and contemporary philosophies of ethics, politics and culture. Fall and Spring 
semesters. (PHIL 356, PHIL 456).

PHILOSOPHY SUMMER SEMINAR IN ATHENS.  A series of Philosophy Summer Seminars in 
Athens (PSSA)] is intended for outstanding undergraduate students who are entertaining the prospect 
of a graduate career in philosophy. The aim is to introduce students to graduate level work and expose 
them to the latest research. Each PSSA focuses on one philosophical topic and culminates into a 
week-long engagement with a distinguished philosopher, who will be presenting their latest research 
on the topic. Students who do not have the opportunity to take high-level courses at their own 
institutions are especially encouraged to apply. The seminar meets daily for a total of 60 contact 
hours. It is highly intensive and is designed so as to immerse students in the state of the art research in 
the field and give them resources, which will enable them to apply to graduate school. The readings 
are demanding and students are expected to engage with them in class. Thus, a prior exposure to 
analytic philosophy will be necessary. Students are responsible for presenting readings to the class 
and for writing one 15-20 page research paper of publishable quality under the guidance of the 
instructor. Summer Session. (PHIL 480)

REASON & REVELATION: PAGANISM AND CHRISTIANITY.  This course introduces students 
to the foundations of Western philosophy, from antiquity to the renaissance, as they develop within 
the Platonic tradition by examining the interaction between Pagan and Christian Platonisms, and it 
explores key themes, arguments, and ideas related to notions such as God, freedom, and the soul. 
Students will reflect upon paradigmatic texts from major thinkers, such as Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch, 
Plotinus, Proclus, and Ficino, and they will engage with questions that are of continuing concern and 
interest to the modern mind, such as ‘What does it mean for one to be free and to determine oneself?’, 
‘What does it mean for the soul to be the source of the self?’, and ‘What bearing does the existence of 
God have on epistemology?’. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to consider the way 
in which the Hellenic tradition has been received and transformed in the hands of various thinkers, 
and how this tradition informs contemporary philosophical discussions. Entitled ‘Reason and 
Revelation: Paganism and Christianity’, this course also probes the relationship between religious 
258 
 
revelation and philosophy. This relationship will be approached from two angles: on the one hand, 
students will assess the way in which Christians used the thought of ancient philosophical schools to 
articulate their religious vision; on the other hand, they will evaluate the importance of revelation and 
religious practice to the Pagan tradition itself. This allows for an investigation of definitive 
philosophical issues, such as life after death and retributive theories of posthumous justice.  Summer

EUROPE TODAY: WINTER IS COMING  The first part of the course will be devoted to analyzing 
the accomplishments and distinctiveness of the European Union as an institution, focusing on 
achievements such as the single market (that allows citizens to live, study, work and retire in any state 
of the Union), the development of a “social Europe” (with universal healthcare, public higher 
education and strong welfare states), and the commitment to the promotion of democracy, human 
rights and gender equality. The focus will be on appreciating how the European Union has been the 
driver of an unprecedented “peace project” that has made allies out of former enemies and has helped 
avert war on the continent for 70 years, after centuries of wars and bloodshed.  When the 
contributions of the European Union are evaluated, the Peace dividend is often taken for granted. 
The second part will focus on new and ongoing challenges facing Europe, including the deep 
repercussions of the departure of the United Kingdom from the Union, the impact of the refugee/ 
migration crisis, the growth of Euroscepticism and authoritarianism, the rise of radical Islam and the 
perceived “clash of civilizations”. The ongoing Covid-19 crisis, which has had a profoundly 
detrimental impact on the economic, political, and social systems of all EU countries and has tested 
European solidarity, will also be examined. 
The third part will address the European Union’s changing place in the world by examining new and 
evolving geopolitical linkages, traditional alliances and rivalries, and evolving bilateral relationships 
with the United States, Russia, China et al. Special attention will be given to the growing challenges 
in the immediate neighborhood, i.e. the Middle East, the Mediterranean basin, Turkey, and the 
Western Balkans. The analysis will be framed within the context of the debate on the future of the EU 
and its role in global and regional affairs. 
Finally, at the end of the semester the students will participate in a simulation game where they will 
apply the knowledge they have gained about the policies and international relations of the European 
Union. The students will be assigned roles representing EU institutions, EU Member States, third-
party stakeholders or press corps and will negotiate a collective European response to an international 
crisis affecting the European Union. Fall and Spring Semesters. (PSCI 327, PSCI 427)

CONTEMPORARY GREEK POLITICS AND SOCIETY. Cast in a comparative framework designed 
to render Greek society and political system more readily intelligible to the average American 
undergraduate, the course explores the history of the modern Greek state in search of insights and 
interpretative keys that might shed light on the country’s current crisis. A salient feature of the course 
is an examination of the central role that the "foreign factor" has played in Greek politics from the 
early 19th century until today. Equally important is the historical investigation of Greek national 
identity--its different sources and strands--in an attempt to explain the sudden growth of anti-
immigrant, xenophobic and ultra-nationalist sentiments. Class sessions are supplemented by a visit to 
the Greek Parliament where students have the opportunity to talk with leading politicians, a walking 
tour of Athens, and the screening of select Greek movies.  Spring Semester. (PSCI 339, PSCI 439)

POLITICAL ECONOMY IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT: FROM ANCIENT GREECE TO 
MODERN GREEK CRISES.  This course considers the current issues and debates of international 
political economy through a critical examination of the ancient Greek world through experiential 
learning left uncovered by traditional on-campus curriculum. Designed as a hybrid course 
synthesizing classical studies and political economy, the course is divided into two parts. Students 
will first have direct contact with a part of the ancient Greek world that expresses the ancient Greek 
economy as an economy and not merely a component of social, political or economic history. 
Through field trips, archaeological site visits and guest lectures, students will then be challenged to 
translate the lessons of antiquity into contemporary relevance through critical debate and analysis.  
Students will consider the relationship between power and wealth, how ancient city-states organized 
trade and financial marketization, consumption, resource sustainability and social institutions, as well 
as the factors leading to their decline. These theories will then be thrashed against 21st century global 
market challenges, with particular focus on the ongoing crises facing Greece. The two most important 
259 
 
centers of the ancient Greek world - Delos (the Delian League) and Delphi - will be visited on two 
separate excursions. Classes will also be held at various archaeological sites in Athens in addition to a 
visit to Parliament and various corporations in and around Attica. Summer Session. (PSCI 340, PSCI

PLAGUE, POLITICS, & POPULISM: CLASSICAL TO MODERN (ATHENS, DELPHI, DELOS, 
MYKONOS) Drawing from ancient texts and modern scholarship, visits to archeological and cultural 
sites in Athens, Delphi and Delos, as well as private meetings with leading academics, business 
experts, NGOs, and government bodies, this course will explore how ancient and modern epidemics – 
specifically the Great Plague of Athens in 430 BC and COVID-19 Pandemic – expose the “fissures 
and fractures” that intensify and foment the economic and political consequences of their respective 
eras. In the case of fifth-century Athens, the plague ultimately cost the city-state a victory against 
Sparta, questioned the leadership of Pericles, and killed a third of the population amidst a climate rife 
with conspiracy theories, rising populism, and xenophobia. Events that seeded the decline of Athenian 
hegemony, and democracy. The comparison to similar patterns emerging today is inescapable, as is 
the expectation that COVID-19 will reshape history for decades to come. With profound economic 
and political uncertainty escalating, students will address contemporary challenges facing Greece and 
Europe, thrashed against the prism of Athenian antecedents. During the first two weeks, students will 
consider the Great Plague’s impact on the political economy of Athens, from the accounts of 
Thucydides, Plato, Greek political thinkers and playwrights, as well as the scholarship of Bresson, 
Kelaidis, and Ober among others. During the second two weeks, these insights and arguments will be 
applied to analyzing how Greece continues battling COVID-19 against the backdrop of decades-long 
economic, political, and social crises. This will include examining (in non-technical terms) both the 
microeconomic impact on households, commerce, and governments, and macroeconomic impact on 
GDP, growth initiatives, and public policy. This framework will challenge students to synthesize all 
course resources, and advance their understanding of Greece and Europe’s role in the future of 
globalization. Summer Session. (PSCI 343).

IMMIGRANTS, CITIZENSHIP AND NATIONALISM IN EUROPE. The course explores the 
challenges of integrating a growing and increasingly diverse immigrant population into relatively 
homogeneous European polities and societies. While taking a broad comparative approach (focusing 
mostly on France, Germany, and the UK), the course pays special attention to Greece, a country 
where national identity is still strongly rooted in the notion of the ancient community of faith, culture, 
and blood and where migrants have not yet gained widespread access to citizenship and political 
participation. Students are exposed to the most recent and influential theories of nationalism, 
ethnicity, citizenship and social integration, but also have a chance to learn “hands-on” by interacting 
with local immigrant communities as well as with representatives of mainstream Greek society 
holding quite differing views on this increasingly controversial social phenomenon. Fall Semester.

10-353, 10-453  
SOLIDARITY|SOCIAL MOVMTS|JUSTICE: SERVICE LEARNING.  In recent years, Greece has 
seen the emergence of what has been called “civil society,” voluntary and social organizations that are 
an integral part of political life, but are not commercial in nature or part of the state. This course 
examines this emergence, along with the changing relationships between citizen and state that have 
been happening concurrently, and the major social issues in contemporary Greece with which these 
organizations and movements concern themselves. Students join such organizations as volunteers, 
devoting a minimum of 45 hours to their internships over the course of the semester. These volunteer 
experiences are integrated into the course, providing an experiential dimension to the questions we 
will be exploring together. There are three main reasons why students want to do a service-learning 
course when they study abroad: they have a personal commitment to service or justice, they want to 
contribute to the community where they will be living, and they want to feel involved and immersed 
in this community and learn about it by being so. This course enriches those goals by providing 
another layer to this experience, as students learn about the history and development of the kinds of 
organizations that welcome volunteers, about why the concept of volunteerism has come to be so 
closely linked to the idea of a functioning democracy, and about why the development of this type of 
activity has occurred in a very specific way in Greece. All efforts are made to match students with 
volunteer positions that align with their interests. Spring Semester. (PSCI 357, PSCI 457) 
10-223, 10-523  
BORDERS, BOUNDARIES AND HUMAN MOBILITY.  Borders exist all around us. We move 
between and within borders in our daily lives whether these borders are real and refer to the external 
borders of a country or social borders, in the form of limits but also opportunities. Membership, 
belonging, segregation, illegality and protection take place in a world where borders are not only 
prevalent but continuously reimagined and reconstructed. Being able to move and cross boundaries, 
but also being able to afford (in the sense of having a choice) to live in particular places have become 
260 
 
increasingly critical dimensions in determining one’s life. Mobility and immobility are linked with the 
ability and option to cross imagined and real boundaries. At best they can result in living ‘good life’. 
But they can also result in exploitation and marginalisation. 
The course utilises the notion of borders to discuss both the construction and reimaging of borders in 
the physical but also socioeconomic sense. Borders in urban spaces operating through logistics and 
infrastructures, gentrification processes, integration discourses and practices; geopolitical and 
historical borders, but also bordering through development and humanitarian work as well as borders 
in and by technological configurations such as algorithms, biometrics, surveillance, big data, drones, 
social media, etc.  Fall and Spring Semesters. (PSCI 362, PSCI 462)

THE EUROPEAN UNION: CHALLENGES AND STRATEGIC CHOICES. With 28 member states 
and nearly half a billion residents, the European Union has grown into a major political and economic 
actor on the world stage. It has promoted peace in Europe for over five decades, changed the way 
Europeans live, as well as the way the rest of the world perceives Europe. The EU has been 
considered a paradigm of a successful “peace project” that promoted stability, prosperity and 
successful cooperation between erstwhile feuding nations. The fact that the Union has grown from its 
original 6 members to the current 28 serves as undeniable proof of the appeal and attractiveness of the 
EU for most countries on the European continent. The ongoing economic crisis in the Eurozone has 
changed this idyllic picture of the EU: in this context, the European Union is being called upon to 
respond to the challenge of the economic crisis and safeguard the common currency, while promoting 
direct policies for confronting the recession and employment by stimulating growth. Moreover, the 
EU must address crucial social issues such as growing disillusionment with the European project, the 
rise of extremism in Europe, and growing polarization between North and South. At the same time, 
the EU faces important international challenges, such as the situation in the Middle East and Ukraine, 
relations with Russia and the United States, and the crucial issue of energy supplies to the Union in 
light of the volatile international situation. Through a combination of lectures, critical analysis in-
class discussions and students’ written work/independent research, this course focuses on the study of 
the history, institutions, policy processes and current challenges of the European Union. Special 
emphasis is being placed on the ongoing economic crisis in the Eurozone area and its political/social 
repercussions, the strategic choices for emerging from the crisis, and the challenges of the 
increasingly unpredictable international environment. Spring Semester. (PSCI 363, PSCI 463)

THE EUROPEAN GOVERNANCE OF MIGRATION: REFLECTIONS ON EMERGING 
RESPONSES.  The objective of the course is to provide students with an overview of the ‘global’ 
governance of irregular migration, looking at the theoretical framework and the policies currently 
implemented in the EU. It looks at the emerging responses to irregular migration and particularly 
maritime irregular migration to the EU from a critical and comparative perspective. It also looks at the 
challenge irregular migration poses for liberal democracies and specifically looks at the border 
management systems in place, border security, and the enforcement measures (and their implications) 
in the EU first and the US. Australia, a country that the EU is currently looking to as a model of 
future practices will also be addressed. Throughout the course, the students have the opportunity to 
meet with representatives of NGOs and understand the reality on the ground as well as visit one 
refugee reception site to comprehend the challenges in place for both host and guest. Prerequisite: 
background in political science and/or international relations.  Fall Semester. (PSCI 384, PSCI 484)

YOUNG ADULTS UNDER THE INFLUENCE IN EUROPE. According to Eurobarometer binge 
drinking (five drinks or more on any one occasion) affects all ages but young people aged 15-24 years 
are the most likely to binge drink every week. Though alcohol is considered socially acceptable in 
Europe, the pattern of binge drinking (BD) or heavy episodic drinking is increasing and expanding 
worldwide. Young Individuals who practice Binge Drinking (BD) are exposed to numerous adverse 
psychological and health-related outcomes. Accidents caused by driving while intoxicated, unwanted 
sexual behavior, and violence or other disruptive behaviours with possible legal implications are some 
261 
 
of these adverse outcomes. In this course, you will study the alcohol’s effects on the brain and body, 
personality traits related to BD and pathways that can potentially lead to the development or 
exacerbation of mental health conditions. Summer Session. (PSY 320, PSY 420)

CONSCIOUSNESS.  Consciousness has been considered one of great mysteries in human existence. 
Historically, psychologists and neuroscientists have largely ignored the problem of conscious 
awareness because it was considered subjective, falling outside the realm of scientific inquiry. 
However, over the past several decades scientists have begun to try to tackle the problem using 
modern scientific tools. In fact, several years ago, a new journal was established entitled 
Neuroscience of Consciousness. In this course, we will begin by trying to define the term and 
consider the so-called “hard” and “easy” problems of consciousness. A brief history of ancient 
civilizations’ views on mental experience will be discussed with particular attention to Greek thinkers 
from the classical period. We will then go over basic neuroscientific concepts and methods that are 
being used to study the neural correlates of consciousness. We will explore different states of 
consciousness and disruptions of consciousness in human patients. We will touch on the related 
problems of intentionality and free will. Finally, we will discuss prevailing scientific theories of 
consciousness. Fall Semester. (PSY 342, PSY 442)

CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS IN UNDERSTANDING FAMILY DYNAMICS  This course is 
designed to assist in students’ cultural understanding of family relationships. The goal of this summer 
course is to improve understanding of the development and maintenance of close relationships, with a 
particular focus on increasing self-awareness and sensitivity to multicultural issues. By the end of this 
course, students should be able to: Compare and contrast key theories related to the study of the 
family; Explain research methods associated with the study of family dynamics; Identify 
characteristics that are associated with family well-being and resilience; Reflect on concepts related to 
the family life cycle and intergenerational patterns; Recognize clinical concerns present in 
problematic family interaction patterns. Summer Session. (PSY 345)

PSYCHOLOGY IN THE POST-PANDEMIC ERA.  This course is an exploration of the current 
mental health trends in the post-pandemic era. We take an in-depth look at the most significant areas 
of psychological science that apply to real life. Examples of topics include inequality, climate change 
anxiety, and boundaries with social media. We also address the stigma surrounding mental health. 
Students have an opportunity to explore all the above through readings in the popular press but 
ultimately a scholarly, critical evaluation of the scientific literature serves as the foundation of our 
learning throughout the course. We learn about new modes of treatment, from mental health apps and 
telehealth to taking a holistic approach when treating mental health. The major goals of this course are 
1) to critically examine psychological theories and processes, and 2) to apply them to your life and to 
real-world events. Fall and Spring Semester. (PSY 352, PSY 452)

TRAUMA AND THE REMAKING OF THE SELF.  This module provides an overview of current 
psychological theories and research in the understanding of human responses to psychological trauma 
and life adversities. Topics include acute stress reactions, and post-traumatic stress disorders resulting 
from interpersonal and family violence, sexual victimization, traumatic loss and death, disaster, and 
other critical life events. Resilience and post-traumatic growth in the face of life challenges will be 
discussed in the second part of the module. There will be a special focus on cultural and gender issues 
in relation to human traumatic stress reactions and resilient functioning. Spring Semester. (PSY 362,

ANCIENT GREEK MYTHOLOGY AND RELIGION. The purpose of the course is to provide a 
knowledge and a method of ‘reading’ Greek myths of the Archaic and Classical periods in their 
cultural and historical context. The course, among other things, examines the nature of Greek myth 
and its representation in Greek art. It also explores how the artistic representation of myth reflected 
social and religious institutions and practices; and finally, it investigates how myth is related to

explore how these teachings manage to affect the everyday lives of their followers. How is a devout 
follower envisaged and how do people shape their lives to fit the image of a devout follower? 
Additionally, we will describe the ways in which Judaism, Christianity and Islam have constructed 
their distinctive meanings, compare them and note the similarities and the debts to each other, keeping 
in mind that various communities with a completely different outlook exist and claim sole orthodoxy

the Greek city from classical times through the Roman period. Having gained understanding of the 
Greek city we will then study the work and thinking of St. Paul and the impact the emergence of 
Christianity had on the Greco-Roman world. The purpose of this class is to introduce students to the 
work and thinking of St. Paul as well as the social impact the emergence of Christianity had on the 
Greco-Roman world. This will be accomplished through a combination of reading, lectures and 
discussion as well as site visits around Greece. Students will be introduced to the life and teaching of

ANTHROPOLOGY OF THE CITY: EXPLORING MODERN ATHENS.  This course has a three-
pronged approach to exploring Athens. The first is general: we will study the "city" as both a concept 
and a material reality, and the theories and issues anthropologists bring to the study of the city. The 
second takes us to the specific: how can we apply those ideas to the city we will be located in, to 
Athens? The third brings us the tools necessary to collect the data for that exploration: the qualitative 
methodologies used in the social sciences to study the spaces, people, practices, sounds, tastes, ideas, 
fields of power, and more that make up everyday life in this incredible city you'll be making your 
temporary home. We will be systematically studying Athens in its material reality, in the experiences 
it shapes, and in the experiences, people shape it with. We will be engaging with how the city 
intersects with gender and sexuality, inequality, migration, sustainability, consumption, capitalism, 
263 
 
politics, activism, state power, housing and homelessness, art, pleasure, and more. This course will 
require you to be brave and open-minded, in interacting with strangers and new places. You will try 
new things you end up loving and other new things you end up greatly disliking. By learning to live in 
and understand another culture, you will also learn more about yourself and your own prejudices and 
predispositions. Winter Intersession. (SOC 315, SOC 415)

TASTING CULTURE:  NORDIC AND MEDITERRANEAN FOOD, TRADITION, AND 
NUTRITION.  We eat to live. But food is not just about survival, it is about so much more: health, 
pleasure, identity, symbolism, class, memory, sensation, and on and on. We express who we are 
through our food. But how we eat is also shaped by other forces: doctors’ advice, economic ability, 
government regulations, climate, history, and many other factors often invisible to us in our everyday 
lives. Over four weeks we will explore two distinct cultural contexts in Europe—Denmark and 
Greece—allowing us to understand both the commonalities and the differences that such forces bring 
to food and cuisine, as well as people’s imagination and inventiveness in creating something to eat. 
The course begins in Copenhagen, Denmark, the emergent capital of New Nordic Cuisine, where 
tradition is being reinvented at levels both every day and haute cuisine. To balance our understanding 
of urban food ways, we will also spend a couple of days on the rural island community of Samsø, 
known for quality produce and sustainable living. The course continues in Athens, Greece, a country 
associated with the Mediterranean diet and a strong cultural history of knowledge and attention to 
food, with a few days on the island of Naxos as well, to explore the locality of food traditions and 
production. These four locations will enable to do comparative research and both explore and 
deconstruct the categories of new/old, urban/rural, north/south, global/local, tradition/modernity, and 
change/continuity. Along the way, the medicalization of diets, changes in agriculture, food tourism, 
food security, nationalism, locality, sustainability, and more will be addressed. When not in the 
classroom, we will visit farms, vineyards, groves, restaurants, markets, museums, kitchens, sweet 
shops, cooperatives, NGOs, and festivals in our quest to experientially study food, and taste 
everything that comes our way. By taking this class, students will develop a sound understanding of 
how food is studied as an expression of society and culture, and hands-on training in the 
methodologies used to examine food and food practices. Summer Session. (SOC 326, SOC 426)

UNDERDOGS, DELINQUENTS, REBELS: A SOCIOLOGY OF TRANSGRESSION. Norms and 
laws constitute the ethical contours of our societies, yet deviance from norms is as old as societies 
themselves. Transgression - a concept defined as conduct that breaks rules, exceeds boundaries or 
social limits, or even breaks the law – is situated at the limits of acceptable behavior. At various 
moments in history moral transgression has been deemed as criminal and/or pathological and as such 
transgressors were harshly punished, either via the legal route or via social exclusion. Transgression is 
central in processes such as labelling, stigmatization and criminalization and historically it has played 
a key role in consolidating and enforcing norms. In all types of societies, some groups are 
systematically situated outside the normative order, for instance, minority groups have played this 
role in modernity. “Good” and “bad”, “moral” and “immoral”, “normal” and “abnormal”, 
“conformity” and “subversion” are binaries produced through this process, which attributes the 
desirable characteristics to the dominant group and the undesirable to those who are perceived as 
deviants across different historical and social contexts.  Fall and Spring Semester. (SOC 358, SOC

SOCIOLOGY OF DISSENT. Dissent occupies a particular place in contemporary societies. On the 
one hand, state mechanisms adopt pre-emptive policies and strategies in an attempt to prevent dissent 
from evolving into civil unrest and disorder, whilst on the other hand, dissent remains the most 
powerful tool in the hands of those social groups who feel and/or are marginalized, excluded or 
silenced. Arising in a number of contexts – the political domain, everyday life, popular culture, sports, 
institutions – dissent has been routinely associated with progressive causes and positive social 
transformation. However, similarly to the germane concept of resistance, dissent can also take 
regressive forms. In recent years, the multiple manifestations of crisis in the West have given rise to 
ideologies and practices with a strong anti-establishment profile coupled with an agenda of social 
exclusion, calling, thus, for a revision of our sociological horizon and analytical tools with regards to 
dissent. Using contemporary Greece as an entry point to these debates and combining key readings 
with interactive learning methods, this course presents a sociological perspective on dissent that calls 
into attention the meanings and conceptual histories of dissent. Fall and Spring Semester. (SOC 360,

PERFORMING (IN) ATHENS: EXPLORING THE CITY THROUGH THEATRE AND 
PERFORMANCE.  Athens is considered one of the most vibrant theatre scenes in Europe. We will 
focus on current practices in theatre and performance mainly in Greece, but also in Europe and the 
United States. We will undertake acritical, historical and creative overview of theatre and 
performance making in periods of crisis, in Europe and the United States, and examine how 
contemporary Greek artists address issues such as: theatre and society, the human body/the body 
politic, and the stage and the city. We will also perform a slight backtrack into the ancient past and the 
beginnings of theatre in its birthplace. The course will include visits to different theatres and other 
performance spaces: a theatre in a train, a 19th century proscenium theatre, underground performance 
spaces, together with backstage tours and talks with artists. This course is for students in the Arts and 
Humanities and anyone interested in theatre and performance. Fall Semester. (THE 320, THE 420)

GREEK THEATER: ANCIENT AND MODERN This course will study and interpret ancient Greek 
drama both in its original context and as it is adapted and performed around the world today. The 
course will examine the origins and cultural context of Greek drama, as well as the performative 
aspects of the plays: theatrical space, stagecraft, music, and dance. It will also focus on key issues that 
the plays are concerned with, especially gender conflict, personal and communal identity, human 
violence, human and divine justice, self-sacrifice, political ambition, and the roles of women, slaves, 
and foreigners. In addition to studying the ancient texts, students will explore the relevance of these 
plays in later times, from the renaissance to today and will examine contemporary adaptations and 
projects based on these plays, especially ones that focus on identity, women, immigrants, veterans of 
war, and violence.  Fall Semester. (THE 325, THE 425)

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: ISLAND COMMUNITIES & CONSERVATION. The course 
comprises a four-week session, which will evolve around the ecological – social work done by the 
not-for-profit (NPO) organization “Healing Lesvos” on Lesvos Island. The organization is monitoring 
the terrestrial and marine environment of the island with a special focus on the northern part that has 
been effected drastically by the environmental, financial and social impacts of the 2015 refugee crisis.

GREEK ISLAND ARCHITECTURE, CULTURE, AND IDENTITY. (NAXOS, AMORGOS, 
SANTORINI, TINOS) This four-week course is a voyage into the life and architecture of four 
Cycladic islands aiming to offer students an opportunity to consider questions of dwelling, belonging, 
and identity through an investigation of their practices of making sustainable living. The overarching 
aim of this course is to explore the meaning of unique island spaces: the private, the public, and the 
communal. We aim to understand what “dwelling” really means when it is fully engaged with the 
environment, histories and local practices. The course will take place on four different islands, each 
revealing a unique history and tradition. We will spend five days on each island sketching, observing, 
writing, interviewing, studying, and exploring what everyday life is like in these communities. The 
final thirteen days will be spent on Tinos where students will be invited to work collectively and 
suggest solutions to the various challenges they observed. The course will conclude with a forum on 
these matters, joined by artists, researchers and architects.  Summer Session. (URBS 334).

FEMINIST URBANISM AND RADICAL GEOGRAPHY: INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE 
AND THE CASE OF GREECE. In the world of global economy, the sense of place has changed 
dramatically over the past decades affecting mostly the physiognomy of metropolitan areas. Socio-
spatial inequalities are more than obvious and social exclusion refers to a wide range of population 
groups. In this context, radical geography and feminist urbanism offers a different perspective on the 
potential for urban development, moving away from the traditional patriarchic patterns. Combined 
with environmental concerns eco-feminist approaches dare to differ from the norm, introducing a 
relatively new scientific field that attracts scholars from different disciplines. In the light of all these, 
this course focuses on radical theories expressing the feminist view on the development of urban 
surroundings. Exploring experimental examples as well as applied policies, students will familiarize 
with the basic theories on the field, elaborating critical thinking on the existing patterns of urban 
265 
 
planning. They will comprehend the international experience on the field as well as the case of 
Greece. The course is suitable for students from different scientific fields as anthropologists, urban 
and regional planners, sociologists, ethnographers and architects. It includes in classroom lessons and 
extended field work so as to study in depth the Greek case study. Field work involves onsite lessons 
in selected neighborhoods characterized by matrilocal societal patterns and also participant 
observation in open public spaces. The ultimate purpose of the course is to widen students’ 
perspective on urban planning issues, offering new tools and strategies for further application and 
research. Spring Semester. (URBS 336, URBS 436)

SUSTAINABLE SOCIAL HOUSING: THE CASE OF GREECE: This course explores the socio-
economic and the environmental impact of social housing in USA and E.U, focusing on Greece. One 
major issue is the low level of preservation and the large number of abandoned buildings. This 
situation contributes to urban blight and socio-spatial inequalities. The aim of the course is to help 
student’s elaborate critical thinking on social housing policies. The course is interdisciplinary based 
on empirical research, suitable for architects, urban planners and designers, environmentalists, 
sociologists and social anthropologists. Students are going to work together as an interdisciplinary 
team in order to evaluate the socio-spatial footprint of social housing in Greece, making the 
appropriate connections with international literature. This course provides also the opportunity to 
familiarize with the basic principles of thematic cartography. Fall semester. (URBS 362, URBS 462)

GLOBAL CITIES & AREAS OF STRATEGIC INTEREST.  This course explores the contemporary 
tendencies and challenges of urban landscape in global cities. It will analyze the variety of forces that 
shape the built environment in a globalize context, focusing on transnational interrelations. 
Comparative studies of Piraeus, London and New York will be conducted.  Spring Semester. (URBS

URBAN SUSTAINABILITY.  Drawing on recent interdisciplinary work in urban studies this course 
examines the, often-conflicting social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable urban 
development theory and practice. In order to problematize the relevant discussion and connect it with 
the production of urban space we will analyze case studies in Athens and attempt to unpack the 
contradictions that are connected with urban development and the use of natural resources in the last 
decades and during the current crisis.  Fall semester. (URBS 370, URBS 470)

URBAN ARCHITECTURE: CONTEMPORARY STORIES IN AN ANCIENT CITY. The city, basin 
and peripheries of Athens have been in constant transformation since its modern foundation. The 
Athenian landscape, environment, society and urban fabric comprise a frantic, diverse and complex 
laboratory of change – designed, informal, democratic, entropic, catastrophic, top-down and bottom-
up. Here the immense pressures, challenges and opportunities for the contemporary Mediterranean 
Metropolis and other global cities may be elucidated and projected upon in medias res, against the 
ancient walkscapes, vibrant commons, human scale, deep palimpsest, horizontal density, living 
typologies, enclave nature, waste landscapes, water networks, migration patterns, crisis conditions, 
civitas and public space of the contemporary city. This analysis and representation seminar examines 
the role and potential of Urban Planning and Design and the challenges of endemic and upcoming 
(climate) Change in ten specific zones, areas or urban enclaves of Athens – all exemplary locations of 
resistance, flux or genesis of urban transformation. How do contemporary theories of urbanism 
measure up against these places? What can design do to affect a city’s future? What new spaces, 
architectures, structures and environments emerge at the edge of the crisis and the wake of even 
greater challenges?  The course is structured in lectures, student presentations and a number of walks. 
Students document their research in papers, maps & media. Fall and Spring Semesters. (URBS 371,
