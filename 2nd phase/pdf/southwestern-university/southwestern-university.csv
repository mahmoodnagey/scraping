COLLEGE YEAR IN ATHENS STUDY ABROAD  
The following courses are for CYA (College Year in Athens) study abroad students only. For more information, please visit 
CYA’s website at www.cyathens.org or contact them at info@cyathens.org or (617) 868-8200. 
Anthropology - ANTH  (CYA)"
05-444,THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF FOOD IN GREECE,4,"The “Mediterranean Diet” has received a great 
deal of attention as a dietary pattern with significant health benefits. To think of diet in this way, 
however, is to think of food as simply nutrition. The rich symbolic life of food, its place in social 
relationships, its importance to ritual, its connection to identity, its deliciousness: all of these are lost 
if we focus on diet as diet alone. In this course, we will look at the development of the Mediterranean 
diet in Greece, as well as other contemporary food practices. We will address issues of globalization, 
food tourism, food security, “local”, “traditional,” and “slow” foods, and much more. When not in the 
classroom, we will visit farms, vineyards, groves, restaurants, markets, museums, kitchens, sweet 
shops, cooperatives, NGOs, and festivals in our quest to experientially study food in Greece. This is a 
hands-on course in terms of tasting and experiencing food! Summer Session. (ANTH 325, ANTH 425)"
05-413,THE CULTURE OF MODERN GREECE,3,"Students studying abroad are already like anthropologists, 
trying to make sense of the rules of the society around them so that they can adapt to the rhythms and 
practices of their new, temporary home. This class gives students the tools needed to fully engage 
with and understand life in Greece, offering the history and social context needed to give their 
experiences greater depth and meaning. We will learn the methods anthropologists use to study 
238 
 
societies, and employ them to investigate Greece in ways students might not otherwise find on their 
own. Our explorations are broad, covering religion, food, immigration, Europeanization, family, 
youth culture, economy and politics, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, and more; we will treat 
these topics as overlapping realms that shape everyday experience. The aim is for students to gain an 
understanding of contemporary society in Greece, and a developing awareness of their own cultural 
conditionings and ethnocentrisms. Fall Semester. (ANTH 333, ANTH 433)"

Archaeology - ARCH  (CYA)"
01-403,INTRO TO DIGITAL ARCHAEOLOGY,3,"Methods of documentation and analysis in archaeology 
have changed drastically in the last decade. The course provides students with theoretical knowledge 
on the state of the art in digital archaeology, including GIS, remote-sensing technologies, tablet-based 
field recording, data management, and, last but not least, theoretical debates on the usefulness of 
digital methods. Students also acquire real-world skills: they create 3D models of artifacts and 
trenches; they create aerial maps using drone photos; they learn how to set-up and use a Total Station 
on the field; and they digitally illustrate 2D architectural features using geo-rectified photos. Fall 
Semester. (ARCH 310, ARCH 410)"
01-434,WHEN EGYPT MEETS THE AEGEAN,4,"The course explores the relationship of Egyptian and Greek 
cultures in the Bronze Age within the wider Eastern Mediterranean context. Focal points of the course 
are the Egyptian Collection in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, Akrotiri in Santorini 
(the Pompeii of the Prehistoric Aegean), Crete, and Mycenae. Students have the very rare opportunity 
to experience hands-on activities and behind the scenes visits which allows them to comprehend more 
deeply the culture through actual contact with artifacts. In addition, distinguished scholars and 
specialists of Greek archaeology share their academic interests and excitement. Summer Session. 
(ARCH 347, ARCH 447)"
01-423,THE TOPOGRAPHY AND MONUMENTS OF ATHENS,3,"Please note: This course is a detailed 
archaeology course intended for students with some background in archaeology and/or ancient 
history.  This exclusively site-based course gives a comprehensive overview of the topography, 
archaeology and history of Athens, focusing particularly on the great monuments of the Classical and 
Roman city. It explores every major site - and many minor ones- paying attention to their physical 
setting, architectural and archaeological characteristics, and position in the political, religious and 
social lives of the Athenians. Thucydides put into the mouth of Pericles the words, ‘Future ages will 
wonder at us, as the present age wonders at us now.’ Future ages did indeed wonder at the buildings 
of the ancient city, and this course traces the rediscovery of Athens’ antiquities from the earliest 
modern travelers to Greece in the 15th century, through to the development of scientific archaeology 
in the 19th, and indeed looks into the role of archaeology in Athens from the foundation of the Modern 
Greek state up to the present day. Students gain a wide range of key skills during the course: 
topographic interpretation from maps and site plans with an understanding of how landscape affects 
site development; research skills from assessing publications from excavation reports to antiquarian 
rare books and archival or photographic collections; oral presentation skills through preparing 
240 
 
individual reports presented on site to the group; as well as gaining an ability to use the evidence of 
archaeology, architecture, inscriptions, and coins in the construction of historical arguments. 
Prerequisite: Background in archaeology and/or ancient history. Cannot be taken with 01-313 (ARCH 
331).  Fall and Spring Semesters. (ARCH 361, ARCH 461)"
01-483,ARCHAEOLOGICAL DRAWING,3,"For students planning to pursue a career in archaeology, this 
course develops basic techniques in drawing pottery and other archaeological finds, such as bone, 
metal, stone and figurines. The course is important, as students first learn the fundamentals of 
observing objects before they learn how to draw them. They can then apply and expand on these 
fundamentals when working with newer recording technologies such as digital recording, and 3-D 
scanning and imaging. Indeed, to make the imagery work students need to know how to see an object, 
which they learn from drawing. The skills acquired have enabled students to work at many 
excavations, e.g. in Egypt, at Troy, and in the Athenian Agora. Enrollment is limited to eight students. 
Spring Semester. (ARCH 416)"
01-523,FROM EXCAVATION TO PUBLICATION,3,"This advanced seminar consists of twelve sessions 
focusing on the different stages of archaeological fieldwork from the site to the final publication. 
Participants need no prerequisites apart from an interest in archaeology and/or sciences. Fall and 
Spring Semesters. (ARCH 419)"

Architecture - ARCT  (CYA)"
19-413,BYZANTINE ART AND ARCHITECTURE,3,"The course aims to explore the Byzantine artistic 
production from its origins in the catacomb frescoes of second-century Rome and the Syro-Palaistine 
region, to the art produced during the last centuries of the empire. It aims to provide an introduction to 
the varied physical remains left behind by the Byzantines: architecture (urban as well as rural), 
painting (mural decoration, icon painting and manuscript illumination), luxury objects of the so-called  
 
241 
 
minor arts as well as objects destined for every day, mainly secular, use. The study of the material is 
not confined to the examination of the evolving ‘styles’ and ‘iconographies’ –the pictorial languages 
of these artefacts- but hopes to survey the role of the image in Byzantium as a complex product of 
specific historical, theological and broader political influences considering its use both in religious 
and secular contexts, matters of gender and patronage as well as the cross-cultural exchanges in the 
Mediterranean basin during the Byzantine era. Part of the course examines the various ways through 
which the Byzantine culture influenced the new humanism of the early-Renaissance Europe as well as 
modern perceptions of Byzantium. Class sessions combine lectures, in-depth discussions on primary 
texts and focus on visual and literary material in order to provide a holistic introduction to Eastern 
Mediterranean culture during the Byzantine period. Besides the lectures, guided visits to Byzantine 
monuments are part of the course. The monastery of Hossios Loukas, a functioning establishment to 
date with lavish mosaic decoration dating back to the 11th c., and the castle-state of Mistras in the 
Peloponnese with its numerous frescoed churches and chapels, have been included in the Peloponnese 
field trip itinerary. To gain a broader first-hand understanding of the agenda of the image in 
Byzantium, visits to Hagios Dimitrios, the Acheiropoietos and Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki are part 
of the northern Greece field trip. Finally, the course aims to explore, in three visits, the Byzantine 
collections, the museums and the surviving Byzantine churches of Athens. Spring Semester.  (ARCT 
364, ARCT 464)"
19-423,ANCIENT GREEK ARCHITECTURE,3,"A study of the major architectural currents in the ancient 
Greek world from the 6th century B.C. to the 2nd century A.D. as these manifest themselves in the 
surviving architectural monuments of Athens. In order students may profit as greatly as possible from 
first-hand, visual contact with the monuments that are the object of their study, almost all sessions of

This course is about the human element of an increasingly integrated global economy. As 
entrepreneurship continues to boost its international character, people become travelers across 
different sociocultural and economic environments. The goal of business strategies and executives 
alike is to make things work in diverse cultural contexts, having to deal with local rules and 
particularities, habits and processes.  Approaching the field is a multi-disciplinary task. Therefore, this 
course borrows elements from various fields: communications, culture, management and business. It 
adopts a multi-dimensional approach to the subject matter, introducing topics such as cross-cultural 
communication, cultural intelligence, negotiations across cultures, workplace social communication, 
culture in virtual teaming etc.  Management and communication systems and techniques can provide 
solutions and point the way forward. However, the starting point lies within people themselves. Fall

Classical Languages - CLAG & CLAL  (CYA)"
02-113,BEGINNING ANCIENT GREEK I,3,"The course consists of an intensive study of the forms, syntax, 
and vocabulary of ancient Greek. Through a systematic and in-depth presentation of vocabulary and 
language forms students develop their skills in reading, comprehension and translation of phrases and, 
eventually, small passages in classical Greek. Apart from the exercises in the textbook, students have 
the opportunity to develop their language skills through additional stimuli such as of short inscriptions 
carved in a variety of media (e.g. stone, ostraca, vases) and simple texts written on coins and papyri.

02-383,THE ILIAD OF HOMER,3,"The course involves a close reading of the Iliad (in translation) and 
constitutes an in-depth exploration of several aspects of the poem, historical, psychological, and 
religious. To begin with the historical setting, the daunting ruins of Troy are viewed as a monument 
that inspired the poet in the seventh century BCE - not earlier. This was a time when the Assyrian 
empire was expanding and Greek soldiers were employed as mercenaries in the Near East and Egypt. 
The possibility that Homer saw these ruins in person is investigated. Emphasis will be placed on the 
analysis of the psychology of the characters: the plight of soldiers fighting far away from their 
country, the guilt of a woman who betrayed her husband, the dark side of pride and egocentrism that 
may lead to madness. Homer includes animals in his enormous literary canvass:  the fear of a timid 
hare seeing a predator approaching matches the fear of a soldier walking resolutely to his death. The 
course finally explores the religious dimension of the poem: do the gods in the Iliad really exist or are 
they figments of human imagination? The poet allows his readers to make up their own minds, but 
246 
 
makes sure that the epiphany of a god is never witnessed by more than one person. His unique grasp 
of the predicament of man as a helpless but heroic creature in lawful but loveless universe makes the 
Iliad one of the best poems ever to have been written.  All texts are in translation. Spring Semester.

Communications – COMM  (CYA)"
15-433,SCIENCE COMMUNICATION,3,"This course is going to provide both a practical and a theoretical

help develop further any scientific project. More importantly, it can positively impact society by 
increasing the Science Capital, promoting scientific literacy, and hence fighting pseudoscience and 
the lack of trust of the public towards scientists. The main purpose of the course is to highlight the 
importance of effective science communication and present the various ways through which it can 
have a positive long-lasting influence on a wide range of audiences (such as creating collaborations 
on an academic level, building trust with the general public and inspiring young school students to 
follow STEM related subjects at school and later at the University). In more detail, the students will 
learn how to share key findings and results from different research groups at NCSR “Demokritos” and 
measure the impact this communication can have on society and the research center. This means the 
students will first familiarize themselves with the scientific method and the different types of 
scientific research on different topics (such as lab work in nanoscience or theoretical work in nuclear

23-413,SOCIOLOGY OF DISSENT,3,"Dissent occupies a particular place in contemporary societies. On the 
one hand, state mechanisms adopt pre-emptive policies and strategies in an attempt to prevent dissent 
from evolving into civil unrest and disorder, whilst on the other hand, dissent remains the most 
powerful tool in the hands of those social groups who feel and/or are marginalized, excluded or 
silenced. Arising in a number of contexts – the political domain, everyday life, popular culture, sports, 
institutions – dissent has been routinely associated with progressive causes and positive social 
transformation. However, similarly to the germane concept of resistance, dissent can also take 
regressive forms. In recent years, the multiple manifestations of crisis in the West have given rise to 
ideologies and practices with a strong anti-establishment profile coupled with an agenda of social 
exclusion, calling, thus, for a revision of our sociological horizon and analytical tools with regards to 
dissent. Using contemporary Greece as an entry point to these debates and combining key readings 
with interactive learning methods, this course presents a sociological perspective on dissent that calls 
into attention the meanings and conceptual histories of dissent. Fall and Spring Semester. (SOC 360,
