REL 3243
History of Religion
3 Hours

History of Religion seeks to answer the question, “Where did religion come from?

With that in mind, the course will look at how the four basic forms of religion and how they have grown and developed.
(1) Individualistic: most basic: simplest. (2) Shamanistic religion to heal, to divine, usually on the behalf of a client. (3) Communal: elaborate set of beliefs and practices; group of people arranged in clans by lineage, age group, or some religious societies; people take on roles based on knowledge.

3 Hours

Sociology of Religion is an overview of the most important themes in the field. The course begins with understanding religion sociologically. Spiritual questions will be raised at the level of the individual (e.g., why are people religious in the first place?; why are women more religious than men?). At the level of the nation-state (e.g., why are some countries more religious that others?; how and why do state-religion relations differ cross-culturally?), and at the level of religious communities (e.g., how are religious communities maintained socially?) The second part of the course is concerned with the profound changes that have taken place in the religious field across the world during the 20th and 21st centuries.
Student will compare the religious field in Europe (ongoing secularization) with the United States (continued high levels of religion) and China (religious revival despite Communist oppression) and try to explain the differences between these cases. The third part of the course looks at the relation between religion and other aspects of civil society. The leading voices in sociology of religion will be considered: Emil Durkheim, the functionalist, Karl Marx with his conflict theory, and Max Weber who emphasized social structure and change of society.

3 Hours

Religion and Law is a critical examination of the relation between concepts of “religion” and “law”, as they figure in modern Christian and Jewish thought, modern legal theory and contemporary debates about religious freedom. If religion gives law its spirit, and law gives religion its structure, then what is their practical relation in both religious and secular life? This course explores the relation between Western, Eastern, and Indigenous conceptions of law, both in their ancient and modern contexts, and the relation between traditional religious and modern secular views of law in debates about the modern nation state.
